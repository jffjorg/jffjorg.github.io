(A &amp; D) and National Community Renaissance of California, while conducting construction work installing a new fire sprinkler system and plumbing at property directly behind the subject premises, were negligent, causing a major water overflow from the property which caused flooding throughout plaintiffs’ entire premises, as a result of which plaintiffs sustained significant property damage and loss of earnings.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that defendants were responsible for three major water flows and flooding, in December of 2018, February of 2019 and March of 2019.&nbsp; &nbsp;The form complaint alleges a cause of action for general negligence.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on March 3, 2023, the court heard two motions brought by the moving party, defendant A &amp; D, to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) from each of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The motions were granted, and plaintiffs were each ordered to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1, 4, 7, and 19, within ten days.&nbsp; The court awarded monetary sanctions in favor of defendant and against each plaintiff in the sum of $2,060.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On November 17, 2023, the court heard two motions brought by defendant A &amp; D to compel additional further supplemental responses from each plaintiff as to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1, 4, and 19.&nbsp; The motions were granted, and further responses were ordered to be served within ten days.&nbsp; The court awarded further monetary sanctions in favor of defendant and against each plaintiff in the sum of $2,560.&nbsp; A request for issue, evidence or terminating sanctions was denied.&nbsp; Counsel Kelleher (counsel for defendant A &amp; D) was ordered to give notice.&nbsp; On November 21, 2023, defendant filed and served Notice of Ruling, attaching the court’s November 17, 2023 minute order granting the motions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>DISCOVERY AT ISSUE:</div><div>Special Interrogatories— Requesting facts in support of cause of action for negligence, facts in support of claim that water intrusion was result of action or inaction by propounding party, identification of documents that support loss of income claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendant A &amp; D brings this motion seeking sanctions for plaintiffs’ failure to supplementally respond to A &amp; D’s Special Interrogatories Set One, Nos. 1, 4 and 19, and to pay the monetary sanctions which have been awarded pursuant to the court’s November 17, 2023 order.&nbsp; Defendant’s counsel indicates in a declaration that as of the date of the declaration, February 6, 2024, defendant has still not received from plaintiff the monetary sanctions award or additional further supplemental responses to A &amp; D’s subject special interrogatory as ordered by the court on November 17, 2023. As noted above, the motions were granted at that time and further responses ordered to be served within ten days.&nbsp; Notice of Ruling was served on November 21, 2023, by electronic transfer and U.S. mail.&nbsp; The further responses were accordingly due within ten days of November 21, 2023, with an additional two days for service by electronic service, so by December 3, 2023.&nbsp; Further responses had not been served as of February 6, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2030.300(e), if a party “fails to obey” a court order compelling further responses to interrogatories, “the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under section 2023.010, “misuse of the discovery process” includes “(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Where there has been such conduct, under CCP section 2023.030 (d), the court may impose a terminating sanction by issuing an order “(1)...striking out the pleadings... of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP sections 2023.030 subdivisions (b) and (c), the court may impose evidence or issue sanctions:</div><div>“(b) The court may impose an issue sanction ordering the designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process.&nbsp; The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.</div><div>(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;The court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Where a court order has been disobeyed, the choice of sanction is within the court’s discretion and will only be set aside for abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Sauer v. Superior Court (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 228.&nbsp; A trial court’s finding that noncompliance was willful will be upheld is supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In general, courts should grant lesser sanctions first before granting terminating sanctions.&nbsp; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771.&nbsp; The Second District in Deyo set out factors which may be relevant in deciding whether to impose sanctions and which sanction to impose:</div><div>“In exercising this discretion, a variety of factors may be relevant, including, 1) the time which has elapsed since interrogatories were served, 2) whether the party served was previously given a voluntary extension of time, 3) the number of interrogatories propounded, 4) whether the unanswered questions sought information which was difficult to obtain, 5) whether the answers supplied were evasive and incomplete, 6) the number of questions which remain unanswered, 7) whether the questions which remain unanswered are material to a particular claim or defense, 8) whether the answering party has acted in good faith, and with reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior orders compelling discovery and the answering party's response thereto, 10) whether the party was unable to comply with the previous order of the court, 11) whether an order allowing more time to answer would enable the answering party to supply the necessary information, and, 12) whether a sanction short of dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction.”</div><div>Deyo, at 796-797.</div><div>The Second District in Deyo noted:&nbsp;</div><div>“The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery. Where a motion to comp[el] has previously been granted, the sanction should not operate in such a fashion as to put the prevailing party in a better position than he would have had if he had obtained the discovery sought and it had been completely favorable to his cause.”&nbsp;</div><div>Deyo, at 793, citation omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The purpose of the Discovery Act is to facilitate discovery with the view toward conducting trial on the merits: “One of the principal purposes of the Discovery Act...is to enable a party to obtain evidence in the control of his adversary in order to further the efficient, economical disposition of cases according to right and justice on the merits.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Caryl Richards, Inc. v. Superior Court (1961, 2nd Dist.) 188 Cal.App.2d 300, 303, italics in the original.&nbsp; Accordingly, Caryl Richards is often quoted in sanctions opinions: “The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.”&nbsp; Caryl Richards,.at 304, citations omitted; see, e.g. Motown Records Corp. v. Superior Court (1984, 2nd Dist.) 155 Cal.App.3d 482, 489.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, plaintiffs have been ordered to provide further responses to interrogatories and have failed to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;The interrogatories were originally propounded and served on May 13, 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;The interrogatories seek the facts supporting plaintiffs’ cause of action for negligence and contentions that an act or omission by moving defendant A &amp; D acts or omissions resulted in the water intrusion plaintiffs claim harmed them, as well as the identification of documents supporting plaintiffs’ loss of earnings claim.&nbsp; This information clearly pertains to this case, and to plaintiffs’ own allegations, and the information should not be difficult for plaintiffs to obtain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that this is the first round of discovery by A &amp; D, and that the information has not been provided in its entirety for nearly two years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs first failed to fully comply with the court’s March 3, 2023 minute order concerning further responses to the subject discovery requests, and now have failed to timely serve any further responses at all in response to the November 17, 2023 order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, this motion concerns only one round of discovery, and involves only responses to three of a set of over 19 discovery requests.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ordinarily in such circumstances, the motion would not be granted but plaintiffs ordered one final time to provide the discovery, and to pay further monetary sanctions.&nbsp; However, the moving papers expressly state that defendant does not seek another court order to supplement responses, stating in the Notice in bold print:</div><div>“A&amp;D is not asking this Court to Order yet again Plaintiffs to further supplementally respond to A&amp;D’s Subject Interrogatories, but A&amp;D is only asking this Honorable Court to impose the requested sanctions.”</div><div>[Motion, p. 2:8-11, emphasis in original].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion does not clearly explain what issue or evidence sanctions are sought, in effect, what issue the court should order be determined in this matter, or what evidence plaintiffs should be prohibited from introducing due to their failure to obey the court’s orders.&nbsp; A terminating sanction is premature, and the fact that defendant has argued it does not want any further discovery orders suggests that the sanctions are not being sought in order to obtain the discovery to which defendant is entitled, but to punish plaintiffs.&nbsp; The trial date is currently set for July 8, 2024, and there does not appear to be any particular urgency in obtaining the subject discovery.&nbsp; The court recognizes that the failure to comply with discovery may be construed as an admission that the case has no merit: “A persistent refusal to comply with an order for production of evidence is tantamount to an admission that the disobedient party really has no meritorious claim...”&nbsp; &nbsp;Kahn v. Kahn (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 372, 382.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there has not yet been shown a persistent refusal to comply with the court’s orders, although the court is aware that plaintiffs are now facing discovery motions from defendant’s co-defendant, and plaintiffs appear to be engaging in a pattern of conduct which may ultimately lead to more serious consequences.&nbsp; The court notes from the file that counsel for the corporate defendant has previously indicated in an ex parte application an intent to move to be relieved as attorney of record, but no noticed motion currently appears in the file.&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the current circumstances, the court will deny the requests for issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions as premature, and award additional monetary sanctions in lieu of those remedies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Monetary Sanctions</div><div>Defendant requests further monetary sanctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2030.300(e) provides that for failure to obey a court order compelling further responses to interrogatories, “In lieu of or in addition to” an issue, evidence or terminating sanction, “the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, CCP § 2023.010 defines misuse of the discovery process to include “(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”&nbsp; &nbsp; Where there has been a misuse of the discovery process, under CCP section 2023.030 (a) the court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.... If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, plaintiffs have failed to obey a court order and defendant has submitted evidence that defendant has been forced to incur expense due to this conduct.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions are awarded.&nbsp; The sanctions sought are $2,260.00.&nbsp; This amount is not reasonable and is adjusted as follows:&nbsp; 5.0 hours preparing the motion; 1.0 hour to appear at the hearing remotely at $200.00 per hour for attorney time for a total of $1,200.00.</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No opposition]</div><div><br></div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion for Monetary Sanctions and for Issue, Evidence and or Terminating Sanctions by A &amp; D Fire Sprinklers, Inc. is GRANTED in part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court finds that plaintiffs Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc. and Shusanik Devine have failed to comply with this Court’s order of March 3, 2024 to pay monetary sanctions, and have failed to comply with this Court’s order of November 17, 2023, requiring plaintiffs to serve further responses to special interrogatories, and to pay monetary sanctions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In lieu of issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions, the Court will award further monetary sanctions. Further monetary sanctions requested by moving party: Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,200.00 (6.0 hours @ $200/hour) (11 hours requested ), plus filing fees in the sum of $60 [Amount Requested $2,260], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant A &amp; D Fire Sprinklers, Inc. and against plaintiffs Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc. and Shushanik Devine, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.&nbsp; CCP§§ 2030.300(e), 2023.010(g) and 2023.030(a).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 22GDCV00514&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  March 29, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>3<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>3/29/2024<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Case No: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>22 GDCV00514<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; June 24, 2024</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Kobaian v.

Plaintiff alleges that the warranty contract contained various warranties, including a bumper-to-bumper warranty, powertrain warranty, and emissions warranty.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that since entering into the warranty agreement, and during the warranty period, the vehicle manifested defects and nonconformity to warranty, including but not limited to, the electrical system, the engine, and the transmission, which defects substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that defendant Ford Motor Company and its representatives have been unable to service or repair the vehicle to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of opportunities, and have failed to promptly replace the subject vehicle or make restitution to plaintiff as required under Civil Code sections 1793.2 and Civil Code section 1793.1, and that plaintiff has been damaged by defendant’s failure to comply with its obligations.&nbsp; It is also alleged that defendant’s failure to comply was willful, in that defendant and its representatives were aware they were unable to service or repair the vehicle to conform to applicable express warranties and does not maintain a qualified third party dispute resolution process complying with statute, entitling plaintiff to civil penalties.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that plaintiff delivered the subject vehicle to defendant Star Ford Lincoln for substantial repair on at least one occasion and that defendant Star Ford Lincoln failed to properly store, prepare and repair the subject vehicle in accordance with industry standards, proximately causing plaintiff damages.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint alleges causes of action for violation of subdivision (D) of Civil Code section 1793.2, violation of subdivision (B) of Civil Code section 1793.2, violation of subdivision (A)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, fraudulent inducement, and negligent repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff seeks an order striking defendant Ford’s objections to plaintiff’s Third Amended and Agreed Notice of Deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable of for Ford Motor Company and Demand to Produce Documents at Depositions, and seeks testimony concerning Category Nos. 1-4, 7-9, 11-19, and 21-24, and the production of documents responsive to Requests Nos. 1, 3, 12, 15, 17, 19, 31, 36, 40, 44, 46, 47, 57, 58, 59, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 77, and 78.</div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers concede that the response served by defendant Ford agreed to produce witnesses in response to certain categories, and in fact defendant produced two PMK witnesses, each for two separate sessions of deposition beginning in December of 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, defendant produced PMK Thea Wilson to testify regarding categories 4-5 and 7, and PMK Greg West to testify regarding categories 1-4, 6-8, 10 and 20.&nbsp; [Exs. 6-10].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Categories Nos. 4-5 and 7 concern communications between Ford and any other person regarding the subject vehicle, Ford’s refusal to promptly repurchase the subject vehicle, and communications with plaintiff.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Categories Nos. 1-4, and 6-8 concern the nature and extent of all service and warranty history of the subject vehicle, the warranties provided by Ford, service advisory notices, technical service bulletins, recalls, defect investigations and other repair documents relating to the subject vehicle, communications regarding the subject vehicle, repair documents with respect to the subject vehicle, and communications with plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Category No. 10 concerns the efforts of Ford to understand and repair the transmission defect including efforts undertaken in response to the defect in Ford vehicles equipped with the same transmission as the subject vehicle.&nbsp; The witness was produced only with respect to procedures performed on the subject vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Category No. 20 concerns the terms of Ford’s owner’s manual, maintenance schedule and warranties as related to the transmission defect.&nbsp;

This result is consistent with the authorities relied upon by plaintiff in the moving papers and reply.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Donlen v. Ford Motor Company (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, for example, the court of appeal found the trial court had improperly granted a motion for new trial in an action claiming violation of the Song Beverly Act, finding that the trial court had properly denied a motion in limine to exclude evidence “of any vehicle other than plaintiff’s truck,” and noting that the evidence had included the opinions of an expert that the transmission in the vehicle was defective before the consumer purchased the truck, based on “the fact that Ford had issued a special service message to dealers” about a transmission problem prior to plaintiff’s purchase. Donlen, at 143-144.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.&nbsp; (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, a consumer had brought an action for violation of the Song-Beverly Act, and the trial court had entered judgment on a jury verdict finding that the act had been unintentionally violated, but the court of appeal found that the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to impose terminating sanctions against defendant for violating discovery orders, in conduct characterized as stonewalling in producing “highly relevant documents.”&nbsp; Doppes, at 994.&nbsp; Those documents included:</div><div>“all documents relating to (1) customer complaints concerning the rust inhibitor used on the 2002 Bentley Arnage; (2) all notices to Bentley dealers for the period 2001 to date concerning the rust inhibitor used on the Bentley Arnage; (3) all warranty repairs during the period of January 2002 to date of the Bentley Arnage related to the rust inhibitor used on the vehicle; (4) all customer complaints of a wax oil smell caused by the rust inhibitor on the 2002 Bentley Arnage; and (5) vehicle tests conducted on the 2002 model year Arnage to confirm whether there was a wax oil smell arising from the vehicle's rust inhibitor.”</div><div>Doppes, at 973-974.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Order here appropriately applies these authorities in expressly permitting discovery of customer complaints relating to defects alleged in plaintiff’s complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.&nbsp;

[Minute Order 8/18/2023, p. 6].&nbsp; &nbsp;The court also does not find persuasive defendant’s cost shifting arguments, given the permissible scope of discovery, and the requirements and limitations imposed in the Order and Notice.&nbsp;

(A to Z), which operated the storage unit where plaintiff’s insureds stored their belongings which were destroyed in a storage unit fire.&nbsp; Plaintiff insurer seeks in this action to recoup from defendant Mueller the damages plaintiff paid to its insureds for the destruction of those belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>Under CCP § 428.50:</div><div>“(a) A party shall file a cross-complaint against any of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him or her before or at the same time as the answer to the complaint or cross-complaint.&nbsp;</div><div>(b) Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any time before the court has set a date for trial.</div><div>(c)&nbsp; A party shall obtain leave of court to file any cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a) or (b).&nbsp; Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the course of the action.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, defendant seeks leave to file a cross-complaint after the court has set a trial date.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant seeks to file a cross-complaint against A to Z for equitable indemnity and declaratory relief.&nbsp; [Walsh Decl., Ex. C].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is held that relief under the permissive provisions of the statute is appropriate when a defendant seeks to file a cross-complaint for indemnity.&nbsp; Platt v. Coldwell Banker Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1444.&nbsp; This is not a situation where the indemnity claims will be lost if not asserted in this matter, so the cross-complaint here would not be compulsory.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The case has already been set for trial, so it is in the court’s discretion to grant leave “in the interest of justice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that good cause and the interests of justice require that defendant be permitted leave to file a cross-complaint.&nbsp; Specifically, defendant argues that since the court has denied defendant’s motion to strike from the FAC the allegations concerning the damages sought for the belongings destroyed in the fire at a facility unrelated to defendant, defendant must have the opportunity to cross-complaint against the third-party business to shift the responsibility for those particular damages.&nbsp; Defendant argues that these fire loss damages are not recoverable against defendant, which had no involvement in the insureds’ selection of the storage unit and was not involved in any way with the fire.&nbsp; Defendant indicates that when the court denied the motion to strike, the court suggested that an alternative method for seeking recourse was for defendant Mueller Industries to file a cross-complaint against the party actually responsible for causing the fire loss damages.&nbsp; [Walsh Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B].&nbsp; The minute order attached does not include such a suggestion.&nbsp; [Ex. B].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, defendant argues that plaintiff in this lawsuit seeks subrogation not only for the water damage allegedly caused by defendant Mueller Industries, but for the losses incurred when a fire broke out ten months later at the third party storage facility storing the insureds’ belongings, so that any liability of defendant for the fire loss incident derives from A to Z’s failure to maintain the insureds’ belongings and prevent fire at its facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that judicial economy would be served by having the claims of the allegedly responsible parties for plaintiff’s losses resolved in a single litigation.&nbsp; Defendant also argues that plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the cross-complaint, as it seeks determination as to defendant’s responsibilities should plaintiff prevail in the complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Generally, the declaration of counsel should show that it would be in the interest of justice to grant leave to file, including some reasonable excuse why the cross-complaint was not filed earlier, such as mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, or recent discovery of new facts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Weil &amp; Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group, 2024 rev.) 6:562.&nbsp; In Crocker Nat. Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 862-864, the court of appeal held there was no abuse of discretion in denying leave to file a permissive cross-complaint five months before trial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, counsel’s declaration indicates that defendant filed a motion to strike portions of the FAC in January of 2024, arguing that defendant was not liable for the damages allegedly caused at the fire at A to Z under the doctrine of superseding cause, that the motion was denied in February of 2024, and that defendant then immediately sought to prepare and file this motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.&nbsp; [Walsh Decl. ¶¶ 2-4].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This explanation does not explain the lengthy delay in seeking to pursue a cross-complaint in this matter, as defendant was on notice that the fire loss damages were being claimed from the time the original complaint was filed in September of 2022, clearly seeking reimbursement to the insurer for the insurance benefits paid for both the water loss incident and the fire loss incident.&nbsp; [Complaint ¶¶18, 26, 33 and Prayer].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is highly unusual for counsel’s declaration to include no explanation of any circumstances justifying the delay of seventeen months in defendant now seeking to add an entirely new party to this action.&nbsp; There is no discussion of how discovery or recent investigation led to the uncovering of facts which would suggest responsibility on the part of the third party which potential responsibility was not evident at the time the complaint was originally filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that leave to file a late permissive cross-complaint under CCP section 428.50 (c) is entirely discretionary, and that the interests of justice would not be served by granting defendant’s motion.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the fire incident in this matter was undetermined and cannot be attributed to A to Z’s actions or omissions to act. Plaintiff argues that if plaintiff had any knowledge of fault against A to Z for the fire and loss, A to Z would have been a named a defendant, but that according to plaintiff's Origin and Cause Expert Jim Brown and the Los Angeles Fire Department, the fire incident was determined to be "accidental and undetermined."&nbsp; &nbsp;[Letofsky Decl. ¶ 7].&nbsp; Plaintiff has not submitted any testimony from the expert or documentation of such a finding but relies only on the hearsay representations of counsel.&nbsp; &nbsp;Counsel’s declaration goes on to report that the origin of the fire was outside the building, with possible causes being a homeless individual or an electrical power line incident, therefore, placing no breach of duty or fault upon A to Z.&nbsp; Plaintiff indicates that without competent evidence linking A to Z to fault for the fire incident, granting leave for Defendant to file a cross-complaint would be unjustified and could unnecessarily complicate the proceedings.&nbsp; [Letofsky Decl. ¶ 7].&nbsp; The argument seems to be that the motion should be denied because there is no possibility that A to Z will be determined to have any liability in the matter, when there is no admissible evidence to support such an argument.&nbsp; Rather, this issue is a factual determination which could be appropriately resolved through the pursuit of a permissive cross-complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that defendant can file a cross-complaint against A to Z after trial with plaintiff, so that while it may be more orderly and expeditious to resolve all claims in a single lawsuit, this result is not required.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff does not point to any specific prejudice it would suffer if leave to amend is permitted.&nbsp; There is a brief argument that adding another party would “complicate” the proceedings, and that plaintiff would be prejudiced by the potential disruption of the timeline leading up to the trial date, impeding the parties’ ability to prepare and adequately adhere to the established proceedings.&nbsp; The only mention of prejudice in counsel’s declaration is that leave is sought, “on the eve of trial,” and that “[g]ranting the motion would most certainly impede the parties’ ability to adhere to the scheduled trial date.”&nbsp; [Letofsky Decl. ¶ 7].&nbsp; There is no indication that witnesses have blocked out time for the scheduled trial date, for example, that evidence will become stale, or that the party plaintiff, an insurer, will suffer from delay in obtaining recovery.&nbsp; Therefore, any prejudice urged could be easily addressed by a continuance of the trial date, which defendant is seeking such a continuance by a separate motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Clearly, the court has a strong interest in having all of these matters tried together and disfavors having defendant be forced to bring another civil action against a potentially responsible party.&nbsp; Such a second lawsuit would likely be related to this action.&nbsp; In that event, the court would stay the second case, or consolidate the two cases until the close of this action.&nbsp; The motion is granted in the interest of judicial efficiency.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, as discussed above, both sides recognize that it would be more efficient to resolve all the pertinent claims in a single action.&nbsp; Also, plaintiff has failed to show any cognizable prejudice which could not be resolved by continuing the trial date.&nbsp; &nbsp;The motion accordingly is granted.&nbsp; The defendant is permitted leave to file its permissive cross-complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Continue Trial&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Mueller has also filed a motion to continue the trial date, which is currently set for May 20, 2024.&nbsp;

and</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the</div><div>motion or application.”</div><div><br></div><div>It is held that a decision to grant a continuance “must be made in an atmosphere of substantial justice,” and that generally, “the strong public policy favoring disposition on the merits outweighs the competing policy favoring judicial efficiency.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Oliveros v. County of Los Angeles (2004, 2nd Dist.) 120 Cal.App.4th 1389, 1395, interpreting predecessor statute, citation omitted.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is held that “absent a lack of diligence or other abusive circumstances...a request for a continuance supported by a showing of good cause usually ought to be granted.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Oliveros, at 1396, quoting Hernandez v. Superior Court (2004, 2nd Dist.) 115 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1246-1247.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, defendant argues that the good cause exists to continue the trial under these factors.&nbsp; As discussed above, the court is permitting the addition of a new party to this action, and due to the filing of the cross-complaint, there has been a significant change in the status of the case, so that the case cannot be ready for trial by the current trial date in May.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant indicates that it seeks a continuance to allow time for proposed cross-complainant A to Z to be properly served with the summons and cross-complaint, to conduct discovery and prepare for trial, and to permit the other parties to conduct discovery and fully prepare for trial.&nbsp; Defendant argues that all parties will need time to conduct discovery as to how the fire occurred and whether A to Z was negligent in protecting the insureds’ belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also indicates that defendant has been unsuccessful in locating the homeowners/insureds to obtain depositions concerning the occurrence which caused the water damage, and that plaintiff’s counsel has refused to make the homeowners available for deposition, so that the court may find that defendant has established an excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Good cause appears on several grounds.&nbsp; The moving papers also indicate that there has been no previous continuance requested in this matter, defendant sought to address the problems giving rise to the necessity by filing a motion to strike, but was unsuccessful, that the length of the continuance sought, ninety days, is reasonable, and that the parties will not suffer any prejudice due to the brief continuance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that good cause is not established because A to Z is not a party to this lawsuit.&nbsp; However, the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint will be granted, so there will in fact be a new party in the lawsuit.&nbsp; The opposition also argues that the testimony of plaintiff’s insureds is not essential to this product liability case, as the circumstances surrounding the water damage can be sufficiently explained through the testimony and report of plaintiff’s expert.&nbsp; This statement is a concession that plaintiff is taking the position that its insureds should not be subject to deposition, when the insureds clearly have knowledge of relevant, and certainly discoverable, material in connection with the matters raised in this litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff fails to establish any prejudice that it would suffer if the continuance is granted.&nbsp; The evidence submitted is set forth in the declaration of counsel, who states, “Moving the trial is unjust to Plaintiff, its insureds, and its experts and counsel.”&nbsp; [Letofsky Decl., para. 11].&nbsp; This does not set forth any facts establishing any prejudice to plaintiff which would impede plaintiff’s ability to properly present its case at trial on the merits. While defendant’s delay in this matter is not ideal, the motion for leave to file the cross-complaint is granted, necessitating a trial continuance, and this companion motion to continue the trial date accordingly also is granted, and the trial and related dates will be continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendant Mueller Industry, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED in the interests of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Cross-Complainant is ordered to efile a separate executed version of the cross-complaint attached to the Walsh Declaration as Exhibit C, by close of business this date and the cross-complaint will be deemed served on the current parties as of the efiling of the pleading.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Mueller Industries, Inc.’s Motion to Continue Trial Date is GRANTED, good cause appearing.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Trial date currently set for May 20, 2024 is advanced to this date and continued to August 26, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Final Status Conference is advanced and continued to August 15, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp; All trial related deadlines and discovery cut-off are to be measured from the new trial date.&nbsp; &nbsp;The OSC Re ADR Compliance currently set for May 9, 2024 is continued to July 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are cautioned that the Court considers the new trial date firm.&nbsp; See CRC Rule 3.1332 (a) (“the dates assigned for a trial are firm.&nbsp; All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.”).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 23GDCV00027&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  March 29, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>5<span style="white-space:pre">						</span></div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>3/29/2024<span style="white-space:pre">					</span></div><div>Case No:&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>23 GDCV00027<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; None Set&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Mendoza v.

&nbsp;To be fair to the parties, if the court is seriously concerned that one of its prior interim rulings might have been erroneous, and thus that it might want to reconsider that ruling on its own motion— something we think will happen rather rarely— it should inform the parties of this concern, solicit briefing, and hold a hearing.&nbsp;

It is alleged in some detail that Ford acquired its knowledge of the defects and its potential consequences prior to plaintiff acquiring the vehicle, from sources not available to consumers such as plaintiff, that Ford intentionally concealed material facts, and breached its duty not to do so, that the facts were material, and that had plaintiff known that the vehicle and its transmission was defective, plaintiff would not have purchased the vehicle.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 33, 34, 70-72].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued in the opposition, with respect to fraudulent concealment claims it is held that a plaintiff is not required to allege with the usual detail required in connection with fraud claims based on affirmative representations.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Vega v.

App.4th 282, the Second District found that the trial court had improperly sustained a demurrer to a concealment cause of action on the ground the cause of action on the ground plaintiff had failed to allege the cause of action “with the requisite degree of specificity,” noting “The pertinent question in a concealment case is not who said what to whom…”&nbsp; Vega, at 296.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff cites to Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System &amp; Planning Association, Inc.

[Citations.] “Thus ‘“the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings … will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.”’ [Citation.] [¶] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which ‘show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’ ” ’ ” (Cf. Blickman Turkus, LP v.

MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC, supra, 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 877–878.) However, as noted above (see fn. 18, ante, at p. 1381), plaintiffs have apparently abandoned their earlier claims of intentional and negligent misrepresentations. As plaintiffs accurately respond, it is harder to apply this rule to a case of simple nondisclosure. “How does one show ‘how’ and ‘by what means’ something didn't happen, or ‘when’ it never happened, or ‘where’ it never happened?”</div><div>Alfaro, at 1384.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also points out that it is held that if the defendant is in a better position to know the facts concerning the alleged fraud, the requirement of specificity is relaxed.&nbsp; See Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v.

Uber Techs, Inc. S272113, or pending further order of the Court.&nbsp; Dhital, 523 P.3d 392.&nbsp; The Rattagan matter involves a certified question from the 9th Circuit, in a case that does not involve Song Beverly claims, Rattagan v.

But plaintiffs alleged the CVT transmissions were defective in that they caused such problems as hesitation, shaking, jerking, and failure to function. The SAC also alleged Nissan was aware of the defects as a result of premarket testing and consumer complaints that were made both to NHTSA and to Nissan and its dealers. It is not clear what additional information Nissan believes should have been included. We decline to hold (again in the absence of a more developed argument on this point) that plaintiffs were required to include in the SAC more detailed allegations about the alleged defects in the CVT.

Plaintiffs alleged that they bought the car from a Nissan dealership, that Nissan backed the car with an express warranty, and that Nissan’s authorized dealerships are its agents for purposes of the sale of Nissan vehicles to consumers.

Dana Corp.

Ford Motor Company (E.D. Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 4793800, *2, citing Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072; Valdez v. J.D. Diffenbaugh Co.

Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, in which the California Supreme Court summarized the economic loss rule as follows:&nbsp;</div><div>“Economic loss consists of “ ‘ “ ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal injury or damages to other property....’ ” ' [Citation.]” (Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 482, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450.) Simply stated, the economic loss rule provides: “ ‘ “[W]here a purchaser's expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has suffered only ‘economic’ losses.” ' This doctrine hinges on a distinction drawn between transactions involving the sale of goods for commercial purposes where economic expectations are protected by commercial and contract law, and those involving the sale of defective products to individual consumers who are injured in a manner which has traditionally been remedied by resort to the law of torts.” (Neibarger v. Universal Cooperatives, Inc. (1992) 439 Mich. 512, 486 N.W.2d 612, 615, fns. omitted.) The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise.&nbsp; (Redarowicz v. Ohlendorf (1982) 92 Ill.2d 171, 65 Ill.Dec. 411, 441 N.E.2d 324, 327.) Quite simply, the economic loss rule “prevent[s] the law of contract and the law of tort from dissolving one into the other.” (Rich Products Corp. v. Kemutec, Inc. (E.D.Wis.1999) 66 F.Supp.2d 937, 969.)”</div><div>Robinson Helicopter, at 988.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also cites Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551, in which the California Supreme Court noted that conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious when it violates an independent duty arising from principles of tort law.&nbsp; Erlich, at 551-552.&nbsp; This is clearly a case where an independent duty to exercise due care in repair of the vehicle is alleged, as discussed above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is clear that Robinson Helicopter is not controlling here, as it involved the applicability of the economic loss rule to fraud claims, not to negligent repair claims.&nbsp; See Robinson Helicopter, at 984 (“In this case, we decide whether the economic loss rule… applies to claims for intentional misrepresentation or fraud in the performance of a contract.”).&nbsp; As noted above in connection with the demurrer of Ford to the sixth cause of action, the Court in Robinson Helicopter, in fact concluded that the economic loss rule did not bar the claim in that action, as the fraud and intentional misrepresentation claim, “is an independent action based in tort…”&nbsp; Robinson Helicopter, at 982.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition relies on case law in which it recognized that the economic loss rule does not apply to cases involving negligent performance of services.&nbsp; Plaintiff relies on, for example, North American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal. App.4th 764, 777-781, in which the Second District ordered issuance of a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order sustaining a demurrer to a negligence cause of action without leave to amend, finding that in cases arising from a contract for the performance of services rather than the sale of goods, the economic loss rule did not limit plaintiff’s tort damages in all cases, as a contract for the performance of services, “necessarily carries with it both the reasonable expectation and implied in law promise that it will be performed with reasonable care.”&nbsp; American Chemical, at 785, see, also, discussion at 777-785.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also points to case law in which it is recognized by federal courts, applying California law, that the economic loss rule does not apply to negligent repair claims where subcomponents of a vehicle cause damage to a larger component or where the component causes damage to the vehicle in which it has been incorporated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Velasco v. Ford Motor Co. (USDC S.D. Cal. 2022) 2002 WL 2287258, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted a motion to remand an action which had been removed to federal court by a vehicle manufacturer invoking diversity jurisdiction.&nbsp; Plaintiff in that case amended his complaint to add a defendant which had allegedly failed to properly store, prepare, diagnose or repair the vehicle in accordance with industry standards.&nbsp; The court in that case directly considered as a factor in its remand determination whether plaintiff’s negligence claim appeared valid, and rejected the economic loss argument being asserted by Star Ford here:</div><div>“First, Defendant FMC argues Plaintiff's negligent repair claim against Defendant RP is barred by California's economic loss rule. Doc. No. 17 at 7–8. Under the economic loss rule, a plaintiff may not recover purely economic damages for tort claims. Jimenez v. Superior Court, 29 Cal.4th 473, 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d 450, 455–56 (Cal. 2002). However, the component exception recognizes that “the economic loss rule does not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product (e.g., a window) causes to other portions of a larger product (e.g., a house) into which the former has been incorporated.” Id., 127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 58 P.3d at 457. Multiple district courts, including this Court, have recognized the potential applicability of the component exception in cases involving negligent repair claims against parties sought to be joined in breach of warranty cases against manufacturers.

representation of plaintiff and other partners in a real estate investment joint venture transaction, defendants failed to appropriately advise the parties, and continued representation despite conflicts of interests arising between the partners, ultimately resulting in plaintiff funding the entire real estate purchase, with no written contract to protect plaintiff from the circumstance that two of the other partners’ names remained as purchasers in whom title would vest at closing, and could fail to pay their share of the funding after closing.&nbsp; The partners failed to pay, and the complaint also alleges that although the partners agreed to execute and executed a notarized&nbsp; Reconveyance Grant Deed to plaintiff to facilitate a potential sale of the property, defendant falsely claimed that the deed had been forged, and sent a false letter making such allegations to escrow, and other involved parties, clouding title and derailing plaintiff’s efforts to sell the property and mitigate her damages.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that in breach of their duties and ethical obligations to plaintiff, their client, and plaintiff’s spouse, also their client, defendants have filed a civil suit against plaintiff and her spouse on behalf of the other two partners, seeking to quiet title to the property in favor of the other partners according to their purported 50% interest.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that in the course of that lawsuit, defendants are improperly using confidential information derived from plaintiff in the course of defendants’ representation of plaintiff.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on December 5, 2018, the parties filed, and the Court signed a Stipulation and Order Staying Action, staying this matter for all purposes pending resolution of the other action between the partners, which was pending in Van Nuys.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On October 25, 2019, the Court heard a motion brought by defendants Alex Megeredchian, Megeredchian Law and Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian to lift the stay in this matter, arguing that the Van Nuys action had been unsatisfactorily delayed.&nbsp; The motion was denied, the court finding that defendants had not shown good cause to lift the stay.</div><div><br></div><div>These motions were originally scheduled to be heard on September 25, 2020.&nbsp; The minute order indicates that at the hearing, counsel represented to the court that they had lost their Mandatory Settlement Conference date and Trial Date in the Van Nuys action.&nbsp; The Court continued the matters to January 22, 2021 as a “Place Holder Date.”&nbsp; &nbsp;On January 22, 2021, the court again found that the motions were stayed, and continued the matters for “hearing/rescheduling” to October 22, 2021.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The matters have since been continued several times, pursuant to Stipulations and Orders submitted by the parties, as well as minute orders permitting the parties to file motions to lift the stay and provide further information concerning the status of the Van Nuys action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A review of the docket in the Van Nuys case, LC 106885, shows that there has been no further activity in that matter since the previous hearing in this matter, on July 28, 2023, at which the court continued the matter to October 27, 2023, and ordered that the motions would not be heard unless the court entered an order lifting the total stay of this case, and requiring the moving papers and any oppositions be refiled with the new hearing date, with courtesy copies to be delivered to the department the date of filing.&nbsp; &nbsp;The hearing date was then again continued twice, pursuant to the joint stipulation of the parties.&nbsp; &nbsp;The moving papers and oppositions have not been refiled with the court, although a new timely opposition has been filed to the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The docket in the Van Nuys case shows that the parties participated in a non-jury trial in October and November of 2021, and filed written closing argument briefs in February of 2022.&nbsp; Following supplemental briefing and oral argument as ordered by the court, and the issuance of a Tentative Statement of Decision in September of 2022, followed by the filing of objections, responses and requests for clarification, on November 17, 2022, the Van Nuys court filed its Statement of Decision and Findings of Fact in the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the Van Nuys action, plaintiff in this action, Vehanoosh Grigorian, had been sued as a defendant by plaintiffs in that action, Robert Ter-Oganesyan and Meghedy Bandary, along with Zaven Grigorian as defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants in that action, the Grigorians, filed a cross complaint to quiet title to the Skytop property as against plaintiffs in that action as cross-defendants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Notice of entry of judgment was filed by the clerk on December 5, 2022, and was served by mail the same date.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment was entered in favor of defendants in the Van Nuys action, the Grigorians, on the Second Amended Complaint, with plaintiffs in that action, Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary to take nothing by their complaint.&nbsp; Defendants were deemed the prevailing parties, with costs to defendants pursuant to memorandum of costs and attorney fees to defendants, if allowed by statute or contract, by noticed motion.</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment was entered in favor of cross-complainants in the Van Nuys action, the Grigorians, on the First Amended Cross-Complaint, the Van Nuys court declaring that cross-complainants were the 100% owners of the Skytop property, quieting title in favor of cross-complainants, and declaring that cross-defendants in that action, Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary, have no rights, legal or equitable interest in, or title to the Skytop property.&nbsp; The Van Nuys court granted rescission and restitution on cross-complainant’s breach of contract claim. The Van Nuys court awarded monetary damages in favor of cross-complainants in that case, the Grigorians, against cross-defendants Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary, jointly and severally, in the sum of economic damages in the amount of $751,489.29 plus $129,026.22 prejudgment interest (tort claims) plus $195,200.10 (breach of contract claims), for a total of $1,075,715.61.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainants were deemed the prevailing parties, with costs to cross-complainants pursuant to memorandum of costs and attorney fees to cross-complainants, if allowed by statute or contract, by noticed motion.</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that the Van Nuys action was proceeding through briefing on a post-trial motion for attorneys’ fees, which was set to be argued on January 18, 2023.&nbsp; On January 17, 2023, plaintiffs in that action filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings, indicating that the matter was stayed pursuant to an automatic stay caused by the filing in another court of a bankruptcy petition filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court by Robert Ter-Oganesyan and Meghedy Bandary.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On January 18, 2023, the motion for attorney fees was called for hearing in the Van Nuys action, and the minute order indicates that the case had been stayed by filing of bankruptcy proceedings by plaintiffs. The hearing on the motion for attorney fees was continued to July 17, 2023, and the action was also set for a Status Conference Re: Status of Bankruptcy the same date.&nbsp; The July 17, 2023, the matters were taken off calendar by the Van Nuys court.</div><div><br></div><div>The Van Nuys action file also shows that on May 22, 2023, defendants and cross-complainants the Grigorians filed an “Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Monetary Judgment,” which indicates that the Grigorians acknowledge “full satisfaction of the monetary obligations in the December 5, 2022 Judgment” in that action as follows:</div><div>“the Judgment Creditors have accepted payment other than that specified in the Judgment in full satisfaction of the monetary obligations in the Judgment owed to them by Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants Robert TerOganesyan and Meghedy Bandary (“Judgment Debtors”). For the sake of clarity, this Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgment only applies to monetary aspects of the Judgment and does not serve to extinguish aspects of the Judgment relating to the Judgment Creditors’ sole ownership of the ‘Skytop Property’ including but not limited to Paragraph A on page 2 of the Judgment; those portions of the Judgment shall remain active and in full force and effect.”</div><div>[Acknowledgment, LASC Case No. LC106885, filed 05/22/2023, p. 2].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Acknowledgment also indicates:</div><div>“Judgment Creditors have not recorded any abstracts of judgment in any county or filed any judgment liens in the Office of the California Secretary of State. There have been no renewals of the Judgment.</div><div>[Id].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The judgment debtors in the Van Nuys case, and bankruptcy petitioners, Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary, are not parties to this Glendale action, but third parties, although one of the motions before this court is for orders compelling Ter-Oganesyan to comply with a deposition subpoena issued in this case.&nbsp; This Glendale action does not appear to be subject to any automatic bankruptcy stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Accordingly, on October 27, 2023, the court in this matter, in ordering the hearing on the current discovery motions continued, also ordered, “Unopposed request to lift the Stay today is granted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court accordingly will proceed this date to consider the outstanding discovery motions on their merits.&nbsp; As noted above, the parties have not refiled the moving papers and previously filed opposition as previously ordered by the court, but the court has located those documents in the file and considered them.&nbsp; Opposition to the discovery motion pending against plaintiff was timely filed in advance of the current hearing date, on March18, 2024, and has also been considered by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:</div><div>Answers, without objection, to Defendant’s specially prepared interrogatories&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CHRONOLOGY</div><div>Date Discovery served:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span>July 31, 2018</div><div>Extension to respond to:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>September 21, 2018&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Date Responses served: <span style="white-space:pre">		</span>NO RESPONSES SERVED</div><div>Date Motion served:&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">			</span>October 4, 2018 Timely&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>The opposition to the motion indicates that since the filing of the motion plaintiff served responses to the subject discovery.&nbsp; The responses were served on December 31, 2023, after the court vacated the stay of this action and defendants’ counsel granted plaintiff an extension to respond, and before the date set for the hearing.&nbsp; A copy of the responses is submitted with the declaration of counsel, and the responses are verified.&nbsp; [Eisenberg Decl., para. 3, Ex. B].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This posture renders the motion moot, leaving only the issue of monetary sanctions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions</div><div>With respect to the failure to timely respond to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”&nbsp; Where there has been such conduct, under CCP § 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, responding party failed to timely respond to an authorized method of discovery, and made the motion to compel responses necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition to the motion argues that sanctions are not warranted, as the discovery was served on plaintiff’s former attorney of record, who did not forward the discovery to plaintiff and did not prepare responses, and the discovery motions were filed while plaintiff remained unaware of the discovery.&nbsp; Two months later, plaintiff’s current counsel substituted in and promptly obtained a stay of proceedings pending final disposition of the Van Nuys action.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that neither plaintiff nor her current attorney had anything to do with the circumstances that led to the filing of this motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The conduct of former counsel, who was indisputably representing plaintiff at the time, is fairly attributed to plaintiff, and the conduct of former counsel in failing to timely respond to the discovery, or request an extension of time to respond, or respond to meet and confer correspondence which was not even statutorily required all clearly necessitated this motion.&nbsp; Hence, the expense of preparing the motion is fairly shifted to plaintiff and/or former counsel.&nbsp; Sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant requests $1,060 in the notice of motion, although the declaration in support of the motion supports an award of $1,560.&nbsp; The sanctions will not be awarded in any amount exceeding that requested in the notice of motion.&nbsp; The sanctions sought appear reasonable, and the opposition does not challenge the hours sought or the reasonableness of the sanctions sought, but only argues that sanctions are not warranted at all based on the conduct of former counsel.&nbsp; As discussed above, the expense of bringing the motion is properly shifted to plaintiff in this circumstance.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the sanctions sought are awarded in full as requested.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motion for an OSC Re:&nbsp; Order to Compel Compliance with Subpoena</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This matter remains on calendar for a motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for the appearance at deposition of third-party Robert Ter-Oganesyan.&nbsp; The matter is not currently on calendar for a similar motion brought to compel the deposition of third-party Meghedy Bandary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Opposition to the motions was filed jointly on behalf of Ter-Oganesyan and Bandary in December of 2018.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2020.220(c) provides that</div><div>&nbsp;“Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the following of any deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service&nbsp;</div><div>(1) Personal attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies.</div><div>(2)&nbsp; &nbsp;Any specified production, inspection, testing and sampling...”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2025.480:</div><div>“(a) If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 1987.1 provides in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>(b) The following persons may make a motion pursuant to subdivision (a):</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span> (1) A party.”</span></div><div><br></div><div>Here, the subpoena was personally served on the deponent, but evidently no objection was served by the deponent, only by the defendants.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deponent failed to appear for the deposition, and a Certificate of Non-Appearance was prepared.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Torabi Decl., ¶¶ 5-20, Exs. 1, 3, 9].&nbsp; &nbsp;The motion indicates the deponent, Robert Ter-Oganesyan, is a third-party who was jointly legally represented by defendants in the transaction which is the subject of this lawsuit.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Torabi Decl. ¶¶ 25-28].&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the deponent is a key witness in this action and without his testimony in this legal malpractice action cannot be properly prepared.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The deponent has been personally served with the subpoena and failed to serve written objection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition filed by counsel for the deponent in 2018 argues that the parties were in the process of stipulating to have this action consolidated with the Van Nuys action, and that plaintiff’s counsel at the time was aware that the deponent was represented by counsel but made no attempt to coordinate the scheduling of the deponent’s deposition with deponent’s counsel or to meet and confer regarding this alleged discovery impasse.&nbsp; [Sievers Decl. ¶¶ 2-9].&nbsp; &nbsp;Counsel indicates that previous counsel was unclear about whether he would continue to represent plaintiff in this action, and whether the deposition schedule could be set up to avoid the deponent having to be deposed twice by plaintiff—once in this case and once in the Van Nuys case.&nbsp; &nbsp;Counsel indicates that Ter-Oganesyan never refused to have a deposition taken.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court construes this argument as a concession that the deposition should be ordered to go forward on a mutually acceptable date.&nbsp; Hence, the motion to compel compliance with the subpoena is granted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion seeks in the alternative an order of contempt against the deponent.&nbsp; Since the motion to compel attendance and testimony will be granted, there is no need for an alternative order, and the request for a contempt order is denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Plaintiff moving party also seeks an order pursuant to CCP section 1992 for the forfeiture of $500 to plaintiff by the deponent.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 1992 which provides:</div><div>“A person failing to appear pursuant to a subpoena or a court order also forfeits to the party aggrieved the sum of five hundred dollars ($500), and all damages that he or she may sustain by the failure of the person to appear pursuant to the subpoena or court order, which forfeiture and damages may be recovered in a civil action.”</div><div>(Emphasis added).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is clear that a separate civil action would be required to obtain the forfeiture.&nbsp; While the California Supreme Court has noted that this is an impractical remedy (see New York Times v. Superior Court (1990) 51 Cal.3d 453, 464), this provision remains in the Discovery Act, and does not permit the recovery of sanctions against the third party in this action.&nbsp; The moving papers do not cite any other statutory authority under which sanctions may be awarded.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The deponent in opposition to the motion seeks sanctions under CCP section 2023.030(a), under which “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP §2023.030(a).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the witness has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, without citing any specified “misuse” of the discovery process under the applicable statute.&nbsp; See CCP § 2023.010.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, CCP § 2023.030 is expressly limited: “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title,” the court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since the opposition papers fail to point to any authorization in the chapter governing subpoenas, or other authorization for a monetary sanction here, the sanctions are denied on this ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Sanctions are authorized under CCP § 1987.2 for orders made under CCP § 1987.1, but neither of these statutes are relied upon or mentioned in the opposition papers).&nbsp; Specifically, CCP § 1987.2 provides:</div><div>“In making an order pursuant to motion made under subdivision (c) of Section 1987.1, the court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of the subpoena as oppressive.”</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there is insufficient argument that the motion was made in bad faith or without substantial justification to allow the deponent to recover sanctions in connection with the subpoena or the motion.&nbsp; No sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Motion to Compel Answers to Specially Prepared Interrogatories is MOOT in light of the service on December 31, 2023 of verified responses to the subject discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:&nbsp; Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,020.00 (2.5 hours @ $400/hour) (2.5 hours requested/3.9 hours supported) [Amount Requested in notice $1,060/ Amount supported $1,560], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendants Alex Megeredchian, Megeredchian Law, and Law Offices of Alex Megeredchian, and against defendant Vehanoosh Grigorian, and plaintiff’s former counsel of record, Torabi Litigation Counsel Group, Law Offices of Kasra Torabi, APLC,&nbsp; payable within 30 days.&nbsp; CCP sections 2030.290(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a) and CRC Rule 3.1348(a).</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff’s Motion for an OSC Re: Order to Compel Compliance with Subpoena for Attendance and Testimony Against Robert Ter-Oganesyan is GRANTED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>At the concession in the opposition, Third Party Robert Ter-Oganesyan is ordered to appear and give testimony at a deposition to be conducted on a mutually agreeable date and time, at the law offices of the attorney for Robert Ter-Oganesyan, to be completed before April 30, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Alternative request for order of contempt is DENIED.</div><div><br></div><div>Request for forfeiture under CCP § 1992 is DENIED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request for monetary sanctions in the opposition is DENIED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court notes that the third-party deponent and counsel preparing the opposition to the motion concerning the subpoena should note that this Court finds it distracting and inconvenient to have to search the footnotes to find supporting authority for assertions made in the body of the points and authorities, and for reference to specific supporting evidence.
