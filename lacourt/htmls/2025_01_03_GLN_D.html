&nbsp;Ivy Fung was the Trustee, with successor Trustees being plaintiff and/or Marie Bernardini.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ivy Fung died in 2017.&nbsp; Ivy Fung transferred her real property in La Crescenta to the revocable trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that the Trust was created by Ivy Fung after she was diagnosed with terminal illness, and was revocable until her death, after which the Trust became irrevocable and all Trust property was to be handed over to her only child and next of kin, plaintiff Ando.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that Marie Bernardini had been named as a successor trustee by connections between Ivy Fung, Bernardini, defendant Chaba Monari and defendant Church of Scientology.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that trust funds were used to pay defendant Monari over $200,000 a year from 2016-2017, and that following the death of Ivy Fung, Marie Bernardini began encumbering the property in La Crescenta with loans facilitated by other defendants, used trust funds and loans to pay off her personal obligations, transferred funds to her company defendant Realty Home Solutions, and that following Marie Bernardini’s death, Bernardini’s husband defendant Jim Cox sold the property to a bona fide purchaser.&nbsp; The trust was depleted of all funds with the exception of $3,000.&nbsp; &nbsp;The FAC also alleges that defendant Jim Cox removed personal property of Ivy Fung from the property, including expensive jewelry.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC also alleges that prior to the death of Jim Cox in January of 2022, Jim Cox sold the family house in Burbank to his son defendant Sean Cox for only the one mortgage remaining on the family house after paying of mortgages and possibly other notes using the assets of the Ivy Fung Revocable Family Trust, thereby converting the assets of the trust to equity in the family house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that defendant Sean Cox is an heir to the estate of Marie Bernardini and acquired assets from that estate which belonged to the Ivy Fung trust, including equity in the family house he purchased from Jim Cox, jewelry, and automobiles belonging to the trust, which assets, after the death of Ivy Fung, belonged to her only heir, plaintiff Ando.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, conversion, and negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on October 6, 2022, the court heard an OSC re: Default Judgment/Default Prove Up, at which the court was informed that defendant Jim Cox Sr. was deceased, with decedent’s son, James Cox Jr. being present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the OSC discharged and stayed the case “in its entirety, pending the disposition of the probate case.”</div><div><br></div><div>On September 11, 2023, the court conducted a Status Conference Re: Stay/Probate Case/Status of Successor in Interest, at which Travis Cox, son of decedent, was present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the stay previously ordered to remain in full force and effect pending a hearing on a motion substituting Travis Cox as a party defendant in this action in place of defendant Jim Cox, deceased, in his capacity as Personal Representative of the Estate of Jim Cox.</div><div><br></div><div>On January 26, 2024, the motion was granted and Travis Cox was substituted as defendant for Jim Cox III.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The matter remained subject to a stay until May 8, 2024, when at a Status Conference the court found that the Probate Court had rejected plaintiff’s creditor’s claim pursuant to Probate Code Section 925, and lifted the stay.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on October 30, 2023, plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, amending the complaint by substituting the true name of Sean Cox for the fictitious name of defendant Doe 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 13, 2024, the court heard a demurrer brought by defendant Sean Cox to the complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend as to the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, second cause of action for conspiracy and third cause of action for conversion on the ground the causes of action appeared to be intended to be directed to Doe defendants, but included no charging allegations against the Does or against moving defendant Sean Cox.&nbsp; The demurrer was overruled to the fourth cause of action for negligence, and on all other grounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Sean Cox now challenges the sufficiency of the allegations stated in the FAC,.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Demurrer</div><div>Second Cause of Action – Conspiracy&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer to this cause of action, along with the first and third causes of action, was previously sustained as follows:</span></div><div>“Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND to the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, second cause of action for conspiracy, and third cause of action for conversion on the ground these causes of action appear to be intended to be directed to Doe defendants but include no charging allegations against the Does or against moving defendant Sean Cox.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To state a civil conspiracy a pleading must allege a civil wrong (for example, fraud or battery), the formation and operation of the conspiracy, a wrongful act done pursuant to the conspiracy, and resulting damage.&nbsp; Unruh v. Truck Ins. Exchange (1972) 7 Cal.3d 616, 631, (noted to have been superseded by statute on other grounds in Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The FAC here now alleges that defendants, including specifically Sean Cox, were part of a conspiracy to commit embezzlement and misappropriate funds and property of the trust, that the agreement was oral and implied by the conduct of the conspirators, that assets were acquired which belonged to the fund, and were ultimately acquired by Sean Cox, and that as a result of the acts of the co-conspirators, plaintiff has suffered harm.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 41- 47].&nbsp; This recitation is sufficient to state all elements of the cause of action, and allege charging allegations against defendant Sean Cox to satisfy the court’s previous concerns.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that the allegations are conclusory, and do not include allegations of knowledge of the planned wrongful conduct, agreement or intent to aid.&nbsp; However, the pleading does in fact include such allegations, and alleges that defendants operated through their connection with the Church of Scientology, and the general allegations provide details concerning the connection between Marie Bernardini, Jim Cox, her husband, and Sean Cox, Jim Cox’s son.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 41-47, 25, 29-31].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>There is also an argument that the allegations regarding Sean Cox’s receipt of property are contradictory, as it is alleged that Sean Cox received property from Jim Cox, while there is also an allegation of receipt from the estate of Marie Bernardini.&nbsp; These allegations do not appear contradictory or legally insufficient, and, in any case, under the liberal rules of pleading, parties are permitted to plead duplicative, alternative, or even inconsistent allegations.&nbsp; See Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997, 2nd Dist.) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 177, 180; Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593 (“a party may plead in the alternative and may make inconsistent allegations.”).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer to this cause of action is overruled.&nbsp;</span></div><div>Third Cause of Action—Conversion&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Again, the demurrer to this cause of action was previously sustained on the ground it appeared to be directed to Doe defendants “but include[s] no charging allegations against the Does or against moving defendant Sean Cox.”</span></div><div><br></div><div>To state a cause of action for conversion, plaintiff must allege the following elements: Ownership, or right to possession of property; wrongful disposition of property right; and damages.&nbsp; Imperial Valley Land Co. v. Globe Grain &amp; Milling Co. (1921) 187 Cal. 352, 354-355.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading standards with respect to conversion are ordinarily not particularly strict, and it has long been held that a general allegation that defendants “converted and disposed of the property to their own use,” is sufficient to withstand demurrer.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Daggett v. Gray (1895) 110 Cal. 169, 171.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The pleading here alleges that plaintiff Ando was the rightful owner with the right to possess the trust and all property of the trust, and that defendants, including Sean Cox, knowingly and intentionally took possession of the property by taking funds and assets “for themselves, their company, and their debts.”&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 49, 50]. This recitation is sufficient to state the elements of a conversion claim, and to allege charging allegations against Sean Cox and satisfy the court’s previous concerns.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that the conversion claims are legally deficient as the real property claims regarding the Rose Street property fail because real property cannot be converted and Sean Cox is a bona fide purchaser for value.&nbsp; However, the cause of action includes various other forms of property which were allegedly converted, and a demurrer cannot be sustained to only part of a cause of action.&nbsp; The arguments sound more in affirmative defenses, not in a challenge to the sufficiency of the conversion cause of action, which, as noted above, is subject to a liberal pleading standard.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that conversion claims for money have to be based on specific, identifiable sums.&nbsp; Pleading requirements provide that when money is the subject of a conversion, plaintiff must plead that a specific identifiable sum was taken.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Vu v. California Commerce Club (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 229, 235.&nbsp; As pointed out in the opposition, the pleading attaches checks for specific amounts, alleges the specific amount of $800,000 obtained by Sean Cox, and, in any case, alleges the conversion of not only money but specific personal property, including two automobiles, and jewelry.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 54, 55].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer argues that no specific items are identified, but does not cite to any legal authority requiring such specificity with respect to conversion of personal property claims.&nbsp; The allegation that two automobiles belonging to the trust were converted also appears to sufficiently specify converted items.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 55].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cause of action is sufficiently stated, and the demurrer is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Motion to Strike</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant evidently seeks to strike the entire complaint on the ground the Doe Amendment adding Sean Cox as a defendant was improper because plaintiff’s counsel knew of Cox’s identity and alleged involvement before filing the original complaint.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As argued in the opposition, the support for this argument does not appear from the face of the pleading, and requires a factual showing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 437 provides:</div><div>“(a) The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.</div><div>(b) Where the motion to strike is based on matter of which the court may take judicial notice pursuant to Section 452 or 453 of the Evidence Code, such matter shall be specified in the notice of motion, or in the supporting points and authorities, except as the court may otherwise permit.”</div><div>The argument depends on a declaration of Sean Cox submitted with the motion, which describes and attaches a Facebook exchange.&nbsp; This material does not appear from the face of the pleading, is not subject to judicial notice, and no request to judicially notice the material is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant does indicate in the notice of motion that defendant is requesting that the court take judicial notice of the original complaint and FAC.&nbsp;

[Rabago Decl., para. 8, Ex. B].&nbsp; The motions are accordingly moot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions</div><div>This leaves the issue of sanctions, which are sought by moving parties.&nbsp; With respect to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” A similar provision applies to document demands. CCP § 2031.300(c) (“the court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling…”).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2023.010, misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”&nbsp; Where there has been a misuse of the discovery process, under Section 2023.030(a),&nbsp; the court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a):</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, defendants failed to properly respond to authorized methods of discovery and made the motions necessary. Plaintiff has submitted evidence showing that plaintiff has incurred expenses as a result of the conduct.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The oppositions argue that the sanctions requested should be denied because the notices are procedurally flawed, as they do not include the total amount of sanctions requested.&nbsp; CCP section 2023.040 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.”</div><div><br></div><div>The oppositions argue that there is no mention of sanctions in the notices of motion and no designation of the amount sought.&nbsp; This is not correct; the notices state some variation that plaintiff “will further move this court for an order requiring Defendant and/or Defendant’s counsel…to pay a monetary sanction to Plaintiff.”&nbsp; [Motions, p. 2].&nbsp; This sufficiently specifies the “type” of sanction sought, “monetary.”&nbsp; There is no statutory requirement that the sum being sought be identified in the notice.&nbsp; The statute requires that a request for sanctions be “accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.”&nbsp; CCP section 2023.040.&nbsp; This was done here.&nbsp; [See Liebrech Decls., paras. 10, 11].&nbsp; Sanctions will not be denied based on this procedural argument.</div><div><br></div><div>The oppositions also argue that sanctions should be denied because plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith.&nbsp; The motions are for responses to discovery, for which there is no requirement to meet and confer at all.&nbsp; Defendants have pointed to no statutory authority requiring a meet and confer in such a circumstance, and the argument repeatedly concedes that defendants were aware of deadlines and failed to seek court intervention or a protective order if such was necessary due to the volume of the discovery or reassignment to a new attorney within the same firm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sanctions are not denied for failure to meet and confer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The oppositions argue that defendants were substantially justified in responding to the requests, and in actually serving proper verified responses after the motions were filed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The sanctions are awarded to shift the expense of preparing the motions which defendants’ conduct made necessary.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also argue that the sanctions should be denied because they are unreasonable in amount.&nbsp; The court does not find this a valid argument for denying sanctions altogether in this case, but will consider the argument in determining what reasonable amounts should be awarded. The sanctions requested are $1,830.00 for each of three motions.&nbsp; As pointed out in the oppositions, these appear high for a motion of this nature, particularly at the $500 per hour billing rate.&nbsp; The motions are quite brief, and, as pointed out in the opposition, are similar to motions previously heard seeking initial discovery responses, for which sanctions have been previously awarded.&nbsp; One hour is sought in each motion for reviewing opposition and preparing a reply, but since the oppositions indicate the motions are substantively moot, any time to prepare a reply should be minimal.&nbsp; The fees awarded are adjusted accordingly as follows: 1.5 attorney hours and 2 for hours awarded once for the court appearance for $1,250.00 in attorney fees and 2 hours attorney time for the other motion for $1,000.00 in attorney fees.&nbsp;

Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.&nbsp; The granting or denial of a motion to compel is in the discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; Coy, at 221-222.&nbsp; &nbsp;A court should generally consider the following factors:</div><div>The relationship of the information sought to the issues framed in the pleadings;</div><div>The likelihood that disclosure will be of practical benefit to the party seeking discovery;</div><div>The burden or expense likely to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information sought.</div><div>Columbia Broadcast System, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The special interrogatories at issue seek information such as a description of how the website was designed to be equally enjoyed for blind users, facts supporting contentions, technical requirements and criteria used in measuring compliance with accessibility standards, software programs used to measure accessibility, dates of testing, test results, details concerning testing, persons and documents related to testing, changes to the website since the filing of this lawsuit, and changes that are not readily achievable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The responses are objections that the requests are overbroad, burdensome, and intended to harass, and then some variation of either “Defendant is unable to respond to this interrogatory as the request is best reserved for an expert,” or that defendant is unaware of the information because “Defendant uses the WIX platform.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These responses are not appropriate, and defendant does not in the opposition even attempt to justify the boilerplate objections.&nbsp; Defendant primarily argues that the information is equally available to plaintiff and plaintiff’s experts, and that the interrogatories seek irrelevant information, and improperly attempt to shift expert discovery obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The objections which have been asserted are not proper and are overruled. The objections asserted for the first time in the opposition, such as that the information is equally available, do not appear in the responses, and therefore have been waived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, although the statute provides for an objection that the information is “equally available” to the propounding party, such an objection usually applies when a propounding party seeks to force another party to search public records equally available to both.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Alpine Mutual Water Co. v. Superior Court (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45, 53.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, as previously pointed out to defendant, it is not an appropriate response to discovery that response to the requests are best reserved for an expert.&nbsp; As argued by plaintiff, the requests do not require an expert to answer, and, in any case, it is held improper to deny a request where the information is known to the party’s expert witness.&nbsp; Chodos v. Superior Court (1963, 2nd Dist.) 215 Cal.App.2d 318, 323-324 (finding improper objections to requests for admissions that the parties had no “independent information” or called for “an opinion”), Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729, 752 (“Since requests for admissions are not limited to matters within personal knowledge of the responding party, that party has a duty to make a reasonable investigation of the facts before answering items which do not fall within his personal knowledge,” quoting Chodos, at 322.).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To the extent the argument is that defendant utilized a particular platform, it is not clear that defendant made appropriate inquiry to locate the information from sources available to defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued by plaintiff, the responses are clearly incomplete, and not Code compliant.&nbsp; CCP § 2030.210 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following:</div><div>(1) An answer containing the information sought to be discovered.</div><div>(2) An exercise of the party's option to produce writings.</div><div>(3) An objection to the particular interrogatory.”</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2030.220:</div><div>“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.</div><div>(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.</div><div>(c) If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant is ordered to fully comply with the Code.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Requests for Production</div><div>CCP § 2031.310 provides that a party demanding a document inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if the demanding party deems that:</div><div>“(1)&nbsp; &nbsp;A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.</div><div>&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; &nbsp;A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.</div><div>&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; &nbsp;An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997, 2nd Dist.) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once good cause is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996, 2nd Dist.) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.</div><div><br></div><div>The requests here seek documents supporting responses to Special Interrogatories, the subject matter of which is set forth above, concerning subject such as testing, and compliance with accessibility standards, and documents concerning communications between defendant and persons who designed the website, analysis’ performed, policies, changes to the website, franchisor agreements, and communications regarding the website accessibility.&nbsp;

The complaint alleges that, due to a hostile work environment, defendant Tijerina retaliated against plaintiff through plaintiff’s daughter Taya Jones. Jones asked defendant Tijerina repeatedly to use the restroom in the girl’s locker room, Tijerina refused to grant permission.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that Tijerina would not allow Jones to use the restroom (corporal punishment), which caused Jones to wet her pants and physical pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that administrators Graham, Langham, and Friedman are Tijerina’s supervisors, and that on multiple occasions, before Tijerina committed corporal punishment against plaintiff’s daughter, plaintiff had reported intimidation and harassment.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendant LAUSD administration knew of Tijerina’s abuse and hostile work environment and failed to act.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No Opposition]&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant’s UNOPPOSED Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint is confusing, as it appears to be brought by plaintiff Terri Milner on her own behalf, but fails to allege facts which would suggest that plaintiff Milner personally suffered damages; the physical damages alleged, physical pain and abuse, appear to have been suffered by Taya Jones, evidently a minor.&nbsp; It is not clear how the complaint is brought by plaintiff Milner on her own behalf. There are allegations of a hostile work environment and retaliation against plaintiff by conduct directed to her daughter. However, it is not alleged, for example, that plaintiff Milner is an employee of defendant LAUSD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent the complaint is intended to be a complaint to recover damages suffered by plaintiff’s daughter Taya Jones, it is not clear how plaintiff can recover damages for her daughter&nbsp; who is not a named party. Plaintiff has not applied to represent the minor as a guardian ad litem. It appears that Taya Jones was a minor at the time of the events alleged in the complaint. Also, plaintiff Milner cannot represent the minor in this lawsuit in pro per unless Milner is a licensed attorney.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant has also submitted documentation which suggests that any government claim presented in this matter was made as a “Claim for Damages for Taya Jones,” not for plaintiff.&nbsp; [Shaheen Decl., para. 5, 6, Ex. C].&nbsp; It also appears that the claim was rejected on January 26, 2024, but this complaint was not filed until August 2, 2024, so appears to have failed to comply with the six-month filing requirement for a complaint against a public entity set forth in Government Code section 945.6(a)(1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff has also failed to allege any statutory basis for negligence liability on the part of LAUSD.&nbsp; Government Code § 815 provides, “Except as otherwise provided by statute: (a) A public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.” It is accordingly held that when pleading negligence against a public entity, even where the negligence is that of the public entity directly, plaintiff must allege and identify the statute establishing the duty owed by the public entity.&nbsp; Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist.&nbsp; (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792.&nbsp; No such allegations are made here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, the pleading seeks punitive damages against LAUSD. LAUSD moves to strike such allegations under Government Code section Government Code § 818 (“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under Section 3294 of the Civil Code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.”)&nbsp; Although the court is concerned that the motion to strike should have been brought as a separate motion from the demurrer, with a separate reservation made and a separate filing fee paid, the court has considered the motion to strike. It is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ten days leave to amend, if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are ordered to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP § 430.41 before any further demurrer may be filed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 24NNCV03438&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  January 3, 2025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>10&nbsp;</div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>1/3/2024</div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>24 NNCV03438<span style="white-space:pre">				</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Jourdan v.

La Marche (2003) 31 Cal.4th 728 set forth the manner in which the trial court is to apply CCP § 425.16:</div><div>“Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion “requires the court to engage in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken ‘in furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the statute. (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.””&nbsp;</div><div>Jarrow, at 733, quoting Equilon Enterprises v.

Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 908.&nbsp; &nbsp;The recording of a mechanic’s lien is also held to fall&nbsp; within the protection of the special motion to strike statute, as a “protected prelitigation statement preparatory to filing a judicial proceeding.”&nbsp; RGC Gaslamp, LLC v. Ehmcke Sheet Metal Co., Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App. 5th 413, 426.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The argument is that plaintiff’s causes of action arise from allegations that RRM&nbsp; engaged in litigation and engaged in litigation activities, such as submitting a declaration and pursuing enforcement of a mechanic’s lien, which are protected activities.&nbsp; Defendant argues that the causes of action center around allegations that RRM engaged in wrongful conduct by defending against plaintiff’s claims in a prior small claims action, recording a mechanic’s lien in connection with a previous limited civil action, and prosecuting its claims in that previous limited civil action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first cause of action includes allegations that plaintiff suffered damages due to the necessity to appear at 10 court proceedings, mental pressures caused by RRM’s “frivolous lawsuit,” and also refers to the filing of a “baseless mechanic’s lien,” perjury in a “sworn affidavit,” information of which a “Court took notice,” and “illegal actions to fraudulently acquire title to Plaintiff’s property.”&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 8-11].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third cause of action makes similar allegations, and also alleges that defendants served plaintiff with a “fraudulent Mechanic’s Lien filing” and “served Plaintiff with a frivolous Civil Complaint for Damages.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Complaint, paras. 20-23].&nbsp; Such allegations appear to arise out of protected activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the causes of action do not arise out of litigation activities, but are based on defendant’s alleged unauthorized and unwanted delivery of materials and the subsequent damage to plaintiff’s property.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the fraud alleged is the delivery of unwanted materials and billing for unrequested services, and the fraudulent fabrication of a work order and the delivery of materials which were done without plaintiff’s consent or knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If this is the gravamen of plaintiff’s lawsuit, it would appear that the allegations concerning the lawsuit and mechanic’s lien would not be necessary to plaintiff’s claims.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that defendant’s conduct was extortionate and fraudulent, so is excepted from application of the first prong of the special motion to strike statute.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, there is no attempt to plead or show in the opposition that all elements of extortion or other illegality as a matter of law can be established here, and the threshold for establishing an illegality exception is very high.</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff cites, without analysis, Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, in which the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and the Second District denying a special motion to strike where the alleged conduct constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law, finding that since extortionate speech was not constitutionally protected, the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply.&nbsp; Flatley, at 328.&nbsp; (“Extortion is not a constitutionally protected form of speech.”).&nbsp; The Court found that in that case, where defendant did not deny that he made the extortionate statements, and “based on the specific and extreme circumstances of this case,” the activity was extortion as a matter of law, the trial court did not err in denying the special motion to strike. Flatley, at 332-333.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The California Supreme Court recognized a civil cause of action for extortion, based on the criminal statutes:</div><div>“Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent … induced by a wrongful use of force or fear … .” (Pen.

At the first step, the moving defendant bears the burden of identifying all allegations of protected activity, and the claims for relief supported by them.

If the court determines that relief is sought based on allegations arising from activity protected by the statute, the second step is reached. There, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that each challenged claim based on protected activity is legally sufficient and factually substantiated. The court, without resolving evidentiary conflicts, must determine whether the plaintiff's showing, if accepted by the trier of fact, would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. If not, the claim is stricken.

(see Minute Order attached as Exhibit 6).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>23.&nbsp; ….Shortly thereafter, I received a notice of Defendant’s fraudulent Mechanic’s Lien filing.&nbsp; Within weeks, DEFENDANTS served plaintiff with a frivolous Civil Complaint for Damages with a Court Date in approximately May, 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>24….&nbsp; &nbsp;coupled with the post-traumatic stress stemming from the realization that Defendants nearly succeeded in wrongfully seizing Plaintiff’s home.”</div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers have sufficiently established that these allegations arise out of protected activity, acts in furtherance of defendant’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution, as the participation in litigation is protected petitioning activity, and the filing of mechanic’s liens or other prelitigation activity in connection with such filings or recordings constitute written or oral statements or writings made before a judicial proceeding, or made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This showing shifts the burden to plaintiff to establish a probability that plaintiff will prevail on plaintiff’s claims for property damage and fraud based on such allegations of protected activity.&nbsp; Plaintiff in opposition has failed to meet this burden.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The above allegations are accordingly ordered STRICKEN WITH PREJUDICE from the complaint.&nbsp; The Court also orders STRICKEN WITH PREJUDICE Exhibits B-F to the complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion is DENIED as to the other allegations alleged in the first and third causes of action to support the claims for property damage and fraud.&nbsp; Defendant has failed to argue or establish that the other conduct alleged arises from protected activity under any of the statutory grounds included in CCP section 425.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant’s request for mandatory attorney’s fees is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Court finds that defendant Robertson’s Ready Mix, Ltd. was the prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike under CCP section 425.16, entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.&nbsp; The Court awards fees of $5,775.00 [$5,775.00 requested], reflecting time the Court finds was reasonably expended at reasonable billing rates to prevail on the motion and obtain the fee award.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 24NNCV04218&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  January 3, 2025&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>11<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>&nbsp;</div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>1/3/2025<span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>24 NNCV04218<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Lee, et al. v.

Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.”</div><div><br></div><div>The proof of service appears to fully comply with this statute, as it is accompanied by a declaration of diligence, and shows follow-up mailing.&nbsp; The motion appears to concede that Jennifer Kim was in fact served with the summons and complaint and is defendant’s daughter.&nbsp; The argument that this person has no involvement in this case does not defeat service by substituted service.&nbsp; &nbsp;The statute requires that the documents be delivered “in the presence of a competent member of the household…at least 18 years of age.”&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no argument or evidence here that Jennifer Kim is not competent, or is not at least 18 years of age.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no requirement in the statute that the person the documents are delivered in the presence of be involved in the case.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion also argues that service was improper as the address where service was made was not and is not defendant Kim’s usual place of business or his residence, but is the home of defendant’s daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant relies on the declaration of defendant’s daughter, Jennifer Kim, who concedes that service was made as represented, and states:</div><div><br></div><div>“5. My father does not reside at this address.&nbsp;</div><div>6. My father has not lived within the United States for the past five years, and currently resides in Korea.&nbsp;</div><div>7. My father has not conducted business from my home.&nbsp;</div><div>8. I have no involvement with the lawsuit served upon me.&nbsp;</div><div>9.

C, Ex. 2].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs also indicate that defendant Kim must have actual notice of this lawsuit, as a representative of Farmers’ Insurance contacted counsel for plaintiffs as a representative for Farmers’ insured, Chung Koo Kim, and acknowledged receipt of the summons and complaint from its insured.&nbsp; [Myung Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The fact that defendant Kim has knowledge of the lawsuit is not relevant to the inquiry concerning whether the service by substituted service was proper under the statute relied upon.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, the court has reviewed the Lease provision, which states that “Notices may be served at the following address, or at any other location subsequently designated.”&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. A].&nbsp; It also appears that on at least two separately prepared Three Day Notices to plaintiffs, defendant Kim directed that payment by made to the La Crescenta address.&nbsp; [RFJN, Exs. B, C].&nbsp; One of those notices is attached to an unlawful detainer complaint, and evidently defendant is relying on the fact that payment was not made to that address in support of the unlawful detainer claim.&nbsp; &nbsp;[RFJN, Ex. C, Ex. 2].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under the circumstances, it appears that defendant Kim has been conducting business from the subject address, and substituted service was properly made at the address defendant expressly designated.&nbsp; The court finds the showing submitted with the moving papers of questionable credibility, as there is no declaration of defendant submitted attesting that he does not reside at the subject address, or treat it as his usual mailing or business address, and no alternative residence address is identified or shown by credible evidence, such as a driver’s license.&nbsp; The evidence offered that defendant does not conduct business from the service address is from his daughter, without stating facts explaining how she is personally aware of that fact, and the testimony’s accuracy is called into question by the use of that address, more than once, as the legally required place for the delivery of rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court finds the service was proper.
