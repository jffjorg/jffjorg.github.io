Hale dba Jim E. Hale B General Contractor and Plumbing Contractor to inspect and resolve the defects in the subject property.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hale represented that he had repaired the leak, but the leak in fact remained unrepaired, and caused water intrusion and mold growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff hired numerous contractors to repair and abate the leaks, and became ill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In May of 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint for damages against Hale in the Superior Court of California, County of Butte.&nbsp; On May 23, 2022, the court entered judgment against Hall and in favor of plaintiff in the sum of $15,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that at all times mentioned, Hale, as a licensed contractor, was required to be bonded, and was bonded through defendant Hudson Insurance Company.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that in July of 2022 plaintiff contacted defendant Hudson Insurance to recover against Hale’s contractor bond, but on July 20, 2022, defendant denied any claim by plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she has been harmed by defendant’s unjustified refusal to recognize and pay plaintiff’s asserted claim.</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on March 17, 2023, at a hearing on a demurrer and motion to strike with respect to defendant’s first amended answer, the court issued a stay in this case.&nbsp; &nbsp;The minute order states, “The Court hereby stays the case in its entirety, with the exception of filing a Responsive Pleading as ordered in today’s tentative ruling.”</div><div><br></div><div>The subject responsive pleading, the Second Amended Answer, was filed on March 24, 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On October 3, 2023, at a Case Management Conference and Status Conference Re: Stay, the court indicated that it had read and considered the Declaration filed by counsel re: status of case in Butte County, and, after conferring with counsel, ordered, “The Stay issued in this case remains in effect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On March 6, 2024, at a Case Management Conference, the court ordered, “Stay remains in place.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On May 7, 2024, at a Case Management Conference, the court lifted the stay in the case, and ordered plaintiff to give notice.&nbsp; On May 7, 2024, plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Ruling at Case Management Conference, reflecting that “the Court lifts the stay in the case.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Stay&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the court cannot consider the motion because it was improperly filed and served while this action had been ordered stayed.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, this matter has been subject to a stay since the court ordered the matter stayed on March 17, 2023, with a narrow exception permitting the filing of a responsive pleading, which was filed on March 24, 2023.&nbsp; Since that time, the stay had been a complete stay, and no activity had occurred in this case at all except appearances at and declarations submitted in advance of a Case Management Conference which was continued several times for updates, and heard and continued along with a Status Conference Re: Stay, and variously a Status Conference Re: Appeal on Butte County Casse, and an OSC Re: Why Walker Motion Has Not Been Filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The stay was requested and granted, and maintained as a complete stay while a similar case, if not identical, was pending in Butte County.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>On October 3, 2023, the court indicated that it had read and considered the Declaration filed by counsel re: status of case in Butte County, and, after conferring with counsel, ordered, “The Stay issued in this case remains in effect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On March 6, 2024, at a Case Management Conference, the court ordered, “Stay remains in place.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On May 7, 2024, at the continued Case Management Conference, Status Conference and OSC, the court lifted the stay in the case, and ordered plaintiff to give notice.&nbsp; On May 7, 2024, plaintiff filed and served a “Notice of Ruling at Case Management Conference,” reflecting that “the Court lifts the stay in the case.”&nbsp; The court recalls that the stay was lifted based on representations at the hearing that the court in the Butte County case had entered a judgment in that matter based on the statute of limitations and sent out a notice of judgment, and that the time for appeal in the Butte County case had expired, and plaintiff had not filed an appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, following the filing of the responsive pleading on March 24, 2023 until May 7, 2023, the stay was a complete stay, in place until this court determined there had been a final resolution of the Butte County case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This motion, however, was filed and served on May 6, 2024, before the stay had been lifted on May 7, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition has objected on this ground, and the court agrees that the motion was improperly filed and served while the stay was pending.&nbsp;

Such a motion must be properly filed and served when the filing and service would not violate the court’s order staying this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Insufficient Notice&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also argues in the opposition that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear this motion because the motion was served on insufficient notice.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers here were filed and served by electronic service on May 6, 2024 for a July 19, 2026 hearing date, only 74 days before the hearing, not the 75 required, and when, due to the use of electronic service, plaintiff was also entitled to two additional court days’ notice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>CCP § 437c(a)(2) requires that a motion for summary judgment be brought on 75 days’ notice:</div><div>“Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for the hearing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the 75 days’ notice requirement, the requirement is held mandatory in the absence of a stipulation between the parties.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Second District has considered whether trial courts may shorten this time and concluded: “we hold that, in light of the express statutory language, trial courts do not have authority to shorten the minimum notice period for summary judgment hearings.”&nbsp;

Musicians’ Credit Union (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 758, 764 (“the Legislature did not…authorize a trial court to shorten the minimum notice period for hearings on summary judgment motions.&nbsp; Such discretionary language is notably absent from the statute.&nbsp; Moreover, the statutory language regarding minimum notice is mandatory, not directive.”) See also Cuff v. Grossmont Union High School District (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 582, 595-596.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the motion noticed a hearing date of July 19, 2024.&nbsp; Seventy-five days prior to this date was May 5, 2024, computing the time by counting backward from the hearing date, excluding the date of the hearing, as required under CCP § 12c (a) (“Where any law requires an act to be performed no later than a specified number of days before a hearing date, the last day to perform that act shall be determined by counting backward from the hearing date, excluding the date of the hearing as provided by Section 12.”), was&nbsp; May 5, 2024, a Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The summary judgment statute provides at CCP § 437c(a):</div><div>(2) Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.

Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff enrolled at defendant Saint Francis High School of La Canada Flintridge (SFHS) in August of 2020, and that it was important to plaintiff and his family that plaintiff attend a Roman Catholic high school for various strongly held personal reasons.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he was particularly interested in playing organized football with the SFHS teams that participate in defendant California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) organized games against other CIF teams in the Southern California section of CIF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from early 2020 through May 2021, SFHS had no in-person instruction, and no active football program.&nbsp; In June of 2021, plaintiff began attending SFHS’s football camp, and won a place on the Junior Varsity team.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that in August of 2021, plaintiff suffered an injury to his shoulder during football practice, and was in October 2021 evaluated by a doctor and also diagnosed with a tear in the tendon of a finger and prescribed no PE or sports for two weeks.</div><div><br></div><div>In October of 2021, plaintiff alleges that during the first half of a SFHS football game, plaintiff was on the sidelines due to his medical restrictions, wearing his football uniform but not wearing pads or a helmet, when defendant Aidan Austin (Aidan), a fellow student, while wearing his football helmet, aggressively accosted plaintiff verbally for not being tough enough to play through injuries.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges despite Aidan’s continual harassment, plaintiff did not engage in any physical retaliation against Aidan, but Aidan, with his helmet still on, butted plaintiff (who was not wearing a helmet) in the face repeatedly, injuring plaintiff.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges he did not fight back or do anything other than attempt to shield himself from Aidan’s criminal battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that no defendant took any significant disciplinary action against Aidan for the helmet assault, although it occurred in open view of hundreds of people, including one or more of the other defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At halftime, Aidan, obviously undeterred by any defendants, hunted plaintiff down in the weight room and, unprovoked, put plaintiff in a choke hold and beat him repeatedly over the head.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the following day, upon receiving reports of Aidan’s unprovoked violence against plaintiff, defendant John Jordan, Dean of Students of SFHS, punished both of them equally, by suspending them both from Friday’s football game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, Aidan again aggressively hunted plaintiff down in the locker room, threatened him, and proceeded to knee plaintiff in the groin, pulled plaintiff’s jacket over plaintiff’s head and repeatedly struck plaintiff in the head with a closed fist.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he did not fight back and sought only to shield himself, and the incident was videotaped and viewed by Jordan, which showed older players dancing and celebrating the assault.&nbsp; It also documents that plaintiff never struck back.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that again defendants responded by treating plaintiff and Aidan equally, as if both were equally culpable for Aidan’s unprovoked criminal attack, which defendants again did nothing to stop or prevent.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that in mid-October, another SFHS student reported to plaintiff that the student had seen Aidan carrying a knife on campus, and warned plaintiff to stay away from Aidan because he was armed.&nbsp; In the latter half of October, when plaintiff was intimidated and fearful of a knife armed Aidan again attacking him, plaintiff had a video-displayed SnapChat conversation with another SFHS student, in which the other student viewed, near plaintiff, an airsoft gun, and plaintiff made a joke about the airsoft gun being a real firearm. Plaintiff later clarified that it was not real and that he was joking.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, plaintiff and his mother, Marta Recasens, met with Jordan to discuss what Jordan claimed was his and SFHS’s investigation of the foregoing altercations and their aftermath.&nbsp; Jordan informed them that Jordan had a grainy photo of a gun that plaintiff had supposedly displayed on social media, but never presented this image to plaintiff or Recasens.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that during the investigation, Jordan did view the videotape where Aidan attacked plaintiff in the locker room, and interviewed other football players who informed him that plaintiff was being threatened and harassed by Aidan and that plaintiff feared for his life, but did not take proper measures to prevent, protect plaintiff or to properly punish Aidan, the aggressor.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff was under the authority of defendants as a student athlete who qualified to be in the football program and should have been afforded the protection of those authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The day following the meeting with Jordan, plaintiff and Recasen met with SFHS’s Disciplinary Board, comprised of defendant Jordan, defendant Thomas Moran, Principal of SFHS, and six other individuals, in which plaintiff read a statement about the altercations and their aftermath, and admitted in his statement that within a week of Aidan’s most recent beating, plaintiff remembered having commented as a joke on social media that an airsoft gun the plaintiff owned was a real firearm.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that he contritely admitted this joke as inappropriate and asked forgiveness.&nbsp; Plaintiff was then expelled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that had defendants acted more promptly in disciplining and either suspending or expelling Aidan prior to the last assault on plaintiff, plaintiff would not have been frightened and intimidated into joking that the airsoft gun was real, which joke led to plaintiff’s expulsion.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The First Amended Complaint alleges that plaintiff has been damaged as a result of his expulsion, including mental suffering, the loss of the companionship and society of teachers and friends at SFHS, and due to the disciplinary record created with the expulsion, finding it difficult to be accepted as a student at a comparable religious high school and, later, colleges.&nbsp; Plaintiff also alleges that at the new high school in which plaintiff enrolled, he was not allowed to play football for one year due to CIF rules, despite being told by Jordan that no such disciplinary reasons statement would appear on plaintiff’s record.&nbsp; In contrast, Aidan, who was not expelled but suspended, and transferred to a different school, was allowed to participate in football after only six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff appealed the expulsion ruling to CIF explaining the circumstances, but CIF would not change its decision. Plaintiff alleges that CIF failed to properly investigate the matter after it failed to protect plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that prior to Aidan’s attacks, plaintiff had been an honor roll student, but his academic career was damaged when he failed courses because of the stress he endured from the bullying, beating and expulsion, that plaintiff’s football career was harmed as he was not able to play football for over a year, and that plaintiff as a result of the beatings and expulsion, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC also names as defendant Antonio Marti, the President of SFHS.</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that all defendants other than Aidan breached their duty of properly supervising Aidan to ensure that he did not bully or physically abuse plaintiff, and breached their duty by failing to suspend or expel Aidan when Aidan repeatedly battered plaintiff, and that CIF breached its duty to provide protection for plaintiff by not instituting rules and guidelines on bullying and breached its duty in not ensuring that Aidan received the same consequences as plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action against Aidan only for IIED and battery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on November 27, 2024, the moving defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant CIF filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was heard on April 12, 2024, and was sustained with leave to amend as to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on May 20, 2024.&nbsp; Defendant CIF again filed a demurrer to the first and second causes of action of the FAC, which was heard on July 12, 2024.&nbsp; The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural&nbsp;</div><div>Untimely Opposition</div><div>Defendants in the reply argue that the court should disregard the opposition papers because they were untimely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP §1005(b):</div><div>“All papers opposing a motion…shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days… before the hearing.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CRC Rule 3.1300(d), “If the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the opposition was filed and served on July 10, 2024 at 4:30 pm for a July 19, 2024 hearing date.&nbsp; Nine court days before the hearing fell on July 8, 2024.&nbsp; The opposition was accordingly filed and served two court days late.&nbsp; This tardiness has been inconvenient for the court and the courtroom staff, and unfair to the moving parties who have been deprived of those court days within which to file a timely reply.&nbsp; The court, in its discretion, could refuse to consider the untimely opposition, but the court elects not to do so.&nbsp; The court will consider the opposition, only because defendants were able to file a timely reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, plaintiff is cautioned that in the future the court may refuse to consider papers not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>No Previous Demurrer&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, the moving defendants did not previously file a demurrer to the original complaint, but filed an answer.&nbsp; The FAC was only permitted to be filed because co-defendant CIF had successfully brought a demurrer to the original pleading, and plaintiff was permitted leave to amend.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 430.41(b):</div><div>“(b) A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The allegations against the moving defendants do not appear to have been significantly modified in the FAC, and it appears that the arguments now made by moving defendants could have been raised in connection with the original complaint, but were not.&nbsp; The moving papers do not explain why a demurrer is now appropriate, when moving defendants did not previously argue that plaintiff’s pleading was insufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court will hear argument whether it should disregard the demurrer for failure to comply with CCP § 430.41(b).

Stockton Unified School Dist. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1448, in which the court of appeal reversed the trial court’s sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend to an amended complaint brought by a high school student against his school district and his high school’s principal and wrestling coach, alleging they had failed to protect him from an attack by a non-student in a high school restroom.&nbsp; The court of appeal held:</div><div>“In this case, we hold that the complaint of a high school student states a cause of action for damages against his school district and its employees. The complaint alleges employees of the district negligently failed to protect plaintiff Jaime Leger from an attack by a nonstudent in a school restroom, where they knew or reasonably should have known the restroom was unsafe and attacks by nonstudents were likely to occur.”</div><div>Leger, at 1452-1453.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal described the duty of care arising in the school setting as follows:</span></div><div>“As a general rule, one owes no duty to control the conduct of another, nor to warn those endangered by such conduct. Such a duty may arise, however, if '(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct, or (b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives the other a right to protection.' (Rest. 2d Torts (1965) § 315; Thompson v. County of Alameda (1980) 27 Cal.3d 741, 751-752 [167 Cal.Rptr. 70, 614 P.2d 728]; Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California (1976) 17 Cal.3d 425 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 83 A.L.R.3d 1166].)” (Davidson v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 203 [185 Cal.Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894]; see also Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 788-789 [221 Cal.Rptr. 840, 710 P.2d 907]; Williams v. State of California, supra, 34 Cal.3d at p. 23.)</div><div><br></div><div>In Rodriguez v. Inglewood Unified School Dist. (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 707 [230 Cal.Rptr. 823], the court considered whether a school district could be held liable when a student was assaulted on campus by a nonstudent.&nbsp; On the question of duty, the court concluded “that a special relationship is formed between a school district and its students so as to impose an affirmative duty on the district to take all reasonable steps to protect its students.” (P. 715.).</div><div><br></div><div>Although Rodriguez did not address the question, we think it obvious that the individual school employees responsible for supervising plaintiff, such as the principal and the wrestling coach, also had a special relation with plaintiff upon which a duty of care may be founded. (See Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 436.) A contrary conclusion would be wholly untenable in light of the fact that “the right of all students to a school environment fit for learning cannot be questioned. Attendance is mandatory and the aim of all schools is to teach. Teaching and learning cannot take place without the physical and mental well-being of the students. The school premises, in short, must be safe and welcoming. ... [¶] The public school setting is one in which governmental officials are directly in charge of children and their environs, including where they study, eat and play. ... Further, the responsibility of school officials for each of their charges, the children, is heightened as compared to the responsibility of the police for the public in general.” (In re William G. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 550, 563 [221 Cal.Rptr. 118, 709 P.2d 1287].)</div><div><br></div><div>Rodriguez notwithstanding, defendants still contend they should owe no duty to protect plaintiff from this attack. They correctly contend that neither school districts nor their employees are the insurers of the safety of their students. (Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360].) But plaintiff makes no assertion of strict liability; rather, the complaint pleads negligence. Defendants do owe plaintiff a duty to use the degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with comparable duties, would exercise in the same circumstances. (Ibid.)</div><div><br></div><div>Of course, in the present circumstances, the existence of a duty of care depends in part on whether the harm to plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable. (See Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 125 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653].) Neither schools nor their restrooms are dangerous places per se. (Cf. Peterson v. San Francisco Community College Dist., supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 812.) Students are not at risk merely because they are at school. (See Chavez v. Tolleson Elementary School Dist. (1979) 122 Ariz. 472 [595 P.2d 1017, 1 A.L.R.4th 1099].) A contrary conclusion would unreasonably “require virtual round-the-clock supervision or prison-tight security for school premises, ...” (Bartell v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Sch. Dist. (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 492, 500 [147 Cal.Rptr. 898].)</div><div><br></div><div>Here, however, plaintiff's first amended complaint pled that defendants knew or should have known that he was subject to an unusual risk of harm at a specific location on school grounds. Thus, the complaint alleged defendants knew or should have known that members of the junior varsity wrestling team (including plaintiff) were changing clothes before wrestling practice in the unsupervised boys' restroom, that defendants knew or should have known the unsupervised restroom was unsafe for students, and that attacks were likely to occur there. These allegations sufficiently state that the harm to plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable in the absence of supervision or a warning. Plaintiff had no obligation to plead that prior acts of violence had occurred in the restroom. (See Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 129.) For example, school authorities who know of threats of violence that they believe are well-founded may not refrain from taking reasonable preventive measures simply because violence has yet to occur. (See id., at pp. 125-126.)</div><div><br></div><div>Whether plaintiff can prove these allegations, or whether it will be difficult to prove them, are not appropriate questions for a reviewing court when ruling on a demurrer. (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936 [231 Cal.Rptr. 748, 727 P.2d 1029].)</div><div>Leger, at 1458-1460.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal also directly addressed the question of whether a private school, which is not a public school, is subject to a similar duty of care and concluded private schools have such a duty:</span></div><div>“As a general rule, it has been held that a [private] school is not required to provide constant supervision over pupils at all times. Thus, no supervision is required where the school has no reason to think any is required. ... It appears that a [private] school has a duty to provide supervision with respect to a particular activity if the school officials could reasonably anticipate that supervision was required ....” (Annot., Tort Liability of Private Schools and Institutions of Higher Learning for Negligence of, or Lack of Supervision By, Teachers and Other Employees or Agents (1971) 38 A.L.R.3d 908, 916, fns. omitted; italics added.)</div><div><br></div><div>“Where a student is injured in performing a task on the direction of school authorities without supervision, the question of [private] school negligence is one for the jury if there is evidence of the existence of a danger known to the school authorities, who neglect to guard the student against such danger, or if there is an unknown danger which the school, by the exercise of ordinary care as a reasonably prudent person, would have discovered.” (38 A.L.R.3d at p. 919, fn. omitted.)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>“Where the liability of the [private] school is sought to be predicated on alleged negligence of teachers or other employees or agents of the school, it is generally recognized that liability on the part of the school may be established under the doctrine of respondeat superior if negligence within the scope of their employment is shown.” (38 A.L.R.3d at p. 912.).”</div><div><br></div><div>Leger, at 1461-1462</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>Overall, the FAC here similarly alleges breaches of a duty of supervision of students, in this case an actual student as opposed to a non-student, and circumstances showing that the school was aware of violent behavior by the student against plaintiff, but failed to appropriately investigate, or appropriately discipline the aggressor, or take steps to monitor the locker room or promptly review and act on videotapes of incidents of assault, so that subsequent attacks are appropriately viewed as foreseeable.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 22-26, 31-34, 38].&nbsp; A negligence claim against SFHS is alleged on at least one valid recognized theory in the very case law cited by defendants, which is sufficient to withstand demurrer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, to the extent defendants focus on the expulsion aspect of the causes of action, this goes to only part of the causes of action, and the court may not sustain a demurrer to only part of a cause of action. A demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action (or to a particular type of damage or remedy), and a cause will survive demurrer if there are sufficient allegations that might entitle the pleader to relief.&nbsp; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelop. Agency (2003, 2nd Dist.) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046; PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer accordingly is overruled on this ground.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Defendants also seem to argue that because plaintiff did not report the November 5, 2021 incident involving Aidan, the school had no awareness of the incident until later, so there was no foreseeability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, as pointed out in the opposition, and discussed above, the FAC alleges in some depth that defendants were aware of previous incidents between these very two students, and failed to appropriately investigate and determine that Aidan had been the aggressor and was routinely threatening and assaulting plaintiff.&nbsp; It is alleged that during the investigation, defendant Dean of Students Jordan interviewed other football players who informed him that plaintiff was being threatened and harassed by Aidan and that plaintiff feared for his life, but did not take proper measures to prevent, protect plaintiff or to properly punish Aidan, the aggressor. [FAC, paras. 22-26; 31-34, 38]. This showing is sufficient to allege facts supporting foreseeability.&nbsp; In fact, in Leger, the court of appeal observed that plaintiff in that case had no obligation to plead prior acts of violence had occurred, as “school authorities who know of threats of violence that they believe are well-founded may not refrain from taking reasonable preventive measure simply because violence has yet to occur.”&nbsp; Leger, at 1460.&nbsp; Here, previous acts of violence itself were known to defendants. The claim is sufficiently pleaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The individual defendants argue that the demurrer should be sustained as to these parties because they were acting as directors or officers of the religious corporation which runs SFHS, acting while discharging their duties as agents or employees of the school.&nbsp; Defendants rely on general agency law, not cases involving schools, and concede that tort liability can be imposed on agents where acts constitute a breach of duty owed to the third person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As pointed out in the opposition, there is case law under which a special relationship is recognized between individual school employees and students such that a school employee may be individually responsible for a breach of duties arising pursuant to that relationship.&nbsp; See Leger, 1458-1459 (“we think it obvious that the individual school employees responsible for supervising plaintiff, such as the principal and the wrestling coach, also had a special relation with plaintiff upon which a duty of care may be founded.”)&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Here, with respect to the individual defendants, it is alleged that defendant John Jordan, the Dean of Students, was directly involved in handling the alleged incidents of aggression between plaintiff and Aidan, and failed to properly investigate, failed to view available evidence, or failed to act on it once he viewed it, and failed to properly supervise and discipline in connection with harassment and threats of violence.&nbsp; &nbsp;[FAC, paras. 6, 26, 33, 38, 40, 43].&nbsp; This showing is sufficient to withstand demurrer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Similarly, defendant Thomas Moran is alleged to have been principal of SFHS, to have participated in the Disciplinary Board meeting, and to have written a letter to plaintiff’s mother improperly blaming plaintiff for not reporting the incidents, two of which the school was in fact aware, and admitting that video of the locker room incident had been available and viewed by Jordan.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 5, 40, 43].&nbsp; This showing is sufficient to allege a claim against this defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in reply argue that this is a private religious school, not a public school as was the case in authorities cited by plaintiff.&nbsp; However, defendants themselves rely on Leger, which involved a private school, and recognized duties owed based on special relationships with students in the school setting.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted in Leger, where the liability specifically of a “private” school “is sought to be predicated on alleged negligence of teachers or other employees or agents of the school, it is generally recognized that liability on the part of the school may be established under the doctrine of respondeat superior if negligence within the scope of their employment is shown.” Leger, at 1462, quoting 38 A.L.R.3d at p. 912.</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer by defendants Jordan and Moran accordingly is overruled.</div><div><br></div><div>However, it does not appear that any negligence or wrongful conduct is clearly alleged on the part of defendant Antonio Marti, other than that Marti was the president of SFHS, and vaguely, “directly involved in the underlying events as alleged herein.” [FAC, para. 4].&nbsp; He is not identified by name in any other part of the FAC.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition does not separately address this named defendant, instead arguing that the FAC alleges that each of the individual defendants had a duty to plaintiff which was breached, as they were present during the expulsion proceeding and in a position to stop the attacks on plaintiff by Aidan.&nbsp; It is not alleged that this defendant was present at the hearing, or how defendant Marti was in a position to stop the attacks on plaintiff.&nbsp; The demurrer as to this defendant only accordingly is sustained.&nbsp; Since this is the first challenge to the pleading by this defendant, the demurrer is sustained with one opportunity to amend,&nbsp; if appropriate, to more clearly allege the alleged negligent conduct engaged in by defendant Marti.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition discusses at some length that defendants discriminated against plaintiff with their disparate handling of the situations before defendants.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no cause of action alleged for discrimination.&nbsp; The current causes of action against the moving defendants are for negligence and NIED.&nbsp; To the extent the opposition seeks leave to amend to expand the disparate treatment and discrimination claims, such leave will not be granted.&nbsp; If plaintiff finds it appropriate to pursue new causes of action, or otherwise amend the pleading,&nbsp; plaintiff must appropriately seek and obtain advance leave of court to do so.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;RULING:</div><div>Saint Francis High School of LaCanada-Flintridge, Antonio Marti, Thomas Moran and John Jordan’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint:</div><div>The Court in its discretion has reluctantly considered the untimely opposition to the demurrer, filed and served two court days late, only seven court days prior to the hearing.&nbsp;

H].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that at that point, counsel for defendant found that the arguments made by plaintiff’s counsel why an in-person interpreter was necessary to be reasonable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also argues that defendant has failed to address the fact that plaintiff served timely objections to the Notice of IME objecting to any responsibility for a cancellation fee.&nbsp; Specifically, Plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan’s Objection and Response to Defendant’s Demand for Physical Examination indicates:</div><div>“Plaintiff will comply with Defendants’ demand under the following further conditions…&nbsp; 17. Neither Plaintiff or counsel for Plaintiff will be responsible for any cancellation fees, if any, for rescheduling and/or cancelling any examinations set for by the noticing party as no such provision is authorized under the Code of Civil Procedure and is thus improper as a matter of law.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Darbinyan Decl., para. 3, Ex. D].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This objection is not discussed either in the moving papers or the separate statement, when it is clearly highly relevant to the instant dispute.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This result is an unfortunate situation, as no formal request for an interpreter was made, and accommodations could not be made at the last minute, but it also appears that plaintiff did not deliberately fail to appear at the noticed IME, and it does not appear unreasonable to have required an in person interpreter, which has since been provided in concession to the preferability for that situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;The deposition has now been conducted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, defendant has failed to address the objection made by plaintiff concerning the cancellation fee, either in the motion or in the separate statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the opposition seeks sanctions for the cost of having the nurse appear twice ($700), as well as for the expense of opposing this motion in the sum of $1,050 (2 hours preparing opposition, 1 hour preparing for and appearing at hearing @ $350 per hour). [Darbinyan Decl., paras. 3, 4, Ex. G].&nbsp; The argument is basically that defendant has unsuccessfully brought this motion, having failed to show how plaintiff failed to appear for her IME when she was at the doctor’s office for one hour waiting, with the nurse, for an interpreter to arrive.&nbsp; The declaration in support of the motion does not refer to or confirm these facts.&nbsp; [See Darbinyan Decl.].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hence, neither side has entirely prevailed on this motion or provided sufficient argument or evidence to the court justifying any shifting of the expenses in connection with this matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendant Trader Joe’s Company’s Motion to Compel Compliance of is MOOT in light of the representation in the moving papers that the IME had been rescheduled and the confirmation in the opposition that the IME was conducted as rescheduled prior to the hearing on this motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions, including cancellation fee, requested by moving party are DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions requested in the opposition are DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 24GDCV00122&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  July 19, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>6<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>7/19/2024&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>24 GDCV00122 <span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Trial Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Wang v.

Kwan and Ki Tak P. Leung to invest in the Riverbend International School, Inc., which operated a private science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) boarding school for grades 9 through 12 in Atchison, Kansas, and was owned and managed by defendants KLL Investments and Kansas Education Holdings, LLC, which were in turn managed by the individual defendants.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she invested $550,000.00 in Kansas Education Holdings, based on assurances that she would become a shareholder in Kansas Education Holdings, share in the profits of the operation, and would be eligible as a EB-5 shareholder to apply for a green card.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that despite defendant’s promises and assurances that the school was operating at a profit, and the partners would be exploring opening another campus in California, and that plaintiff’s application for a green card would be approved, defendants did not list plaintiff as a shareholder, leading to plaintiff’s loss in the investment money and its benefit, and also leading to plaintiff not being qualified as an EB-5 investor, resulting in the denial of plaintiffs application by the US immigration services.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the defendants misappropriated plaintiff’s investment money, transferring it from the bank account of Riverbend International School immediately after deposit, for their own personal use and their own benefit.&nbsp; Plaintiff has since learned that the school, including the property, has been auctioned by Atchison County to pay off property taxes and wages owed to teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The file shows that this demurrer was originally scheduled to be heard on May 10, 2024, but was continued to this date pursuant to an ex parte application by plaintiff to continue the hearing date.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>On June 7, 2024, the court granted a Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel filed by plaintiff’s attorney.&nbsp; Plaintiff is evidently now representing herself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There has been no timely written opposition filed to this demurrer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants Carol W. Kwan and Ki Tak P. Leung argue that the entire complaint and all causes of action are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.&nbsp; Specifically, defendants argue that the causes of action for breach of contract or account stated must be brought within four years of breach, and an action based on oral contract must be brought within two years of breach pursuant to CCP sections 337 (a)-(b) and 339, and that fraud and conversion causes of action must be brought within three years of discovery of the alleged conversion or fraud under CCP section 338(c)-(d).&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that the complaint discloses a bar to recovery because it concedes that “From the year 2018 to early 2023, Li and Plaintiff were in contact with Leung and Kwan.&nbsp; Li and Plaintiff sent messages to Leung and Kwan to ask for an update regarding Plaintiff’s investment and its returns, but they had no direct reply to Plaintiff and Li’s inquiries.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Complaint, para. 55].&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants argue that plaintiff filed her complaint on January 23, 2024, even though she knew at some time as early as 2018 that something was amiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear from these allegations that any particular cause of action would be barred, as the allegations themselves encompass “early 2023,” which could fall within one year of the filing of the action in January of 2024, so falling within any potential statute of limitations.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, the Second District reversed the trial court’s judgment of dismissal of a legal malpractice action after sustaining a demurrer based on the bar of the one-year statute of limitations, and directed the trial court to overrule the demurrer.&nbsp; The Second District set forth the following standard in connection with a demurrer based on a statute of limitations:</div><div>“On appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend, the reviewing court must accept as true not only those facts alleged in the complaint but also facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Rose v. Royal Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 709, 716 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 483].)&nbsp; A demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be, but is not necessarily, barred. (Moseley v. Abrams (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 355, 359-360 [216 Cal.Rptr. 40].) In order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred. (Mangini v. Aerojet-General Corp. (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1125, 1155 [281 Cal.Rptr. 827].)”</div><div>Marshall, at 1403.&nbsp;</div><div>The Second District in Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 316 followed Marshall in reversing a trial court’s order dismissing causes of action in a racial discrimination case on the ground the claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, observing:</div><div>“A general demurrer based on the statute of limitations is only permissible where the dates alleged in the complaint show that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. (See Saliter v. Pierce Brothers Mortuaries (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 300 [146 Cal.Rptr. 271].) The running of the statute must appear “clearly and affirmatively” from the dates alleged. It is not sufficient that the complaint might be barred. (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].) If the dates&nbsp; establishing the running of the statute of limitations do not clearly appear in the complaint, there is no ground for general demurrer. The proper remedy “is to ascertain the factual basis of the contention through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment ....” (United Western Medical Centers v. Superior Court (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 682].)”</div><div>Roman, at 324-325, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, it is not clear from the pleading that any particular claim is necessarily barred.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that even if plaintiff here intends to rely on an argument that there was a delay in discovery of defendants’ alleged misconduct, such a delay must be alleged with specificity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A review of the complaint shows that it includes a very detailed account of representations and assurances received by plaintiff, while plaintiff was residing in China, concerning awards the school was receiving and that it was thriving, with a business plan proposed for a second school, and the complaint also details plaintiff learning for the first time in June of 2023 that her immigration application had been denied, prompting plaintiff to talk to another member of the investment entities, who revealed details of the wrongdoing to plaintiff for the first time.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 50-75].&nbsp; The following day, it is alleged that Li was in contact with Leung, who provided further details concerning the situation.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 78-79].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The allegations are sufficiently specific to support an inference that there was a reasonable delay in discovery, and if defendants want to pursue the argument further that the delay was not reasonable, they may proceed as the Second District suggested in Roman to ascertain the factual basis of plaintiff’s allegations through discovery and, if necessary, file a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The demurrer on this ground overruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>Sixth Cause of Action—Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing&nbsp;</div><div>It is recognized that “Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.”&nbsp; Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v.

County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 181.&nbsp; The demurrer on this ground accordingly is overruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Eighth Cause of Action—Unjust Enrichment&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that this cause of action fails because there is no independent cause of action for unjust enrichment.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants rely on Melchoir v. New Line Productions, Inc.&nbsp; ( 2003, 2nd Dist.)&nbsp; 106 Cal. App.4th 779, in which the Second District affirmed the granting of summary judgment, noting:</div><div>“In addition, as the trial court observed, there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment. "The phrase 'Unjust Enrichment' does not describe a theory of recovery, but an effect: the result of a failure to make restitution under circumstances where it is equitable to do so." (Lauriedale Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 774].) Unjust enrichment is " 'a general principle, underlying various legal doctrines and remedies,' " rather than a remedy itself. (Dinosaur Development, Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal. App. 3d 1310, 1315 [265 Cal. Rptr. 525].) It is synonymous with restitution. (Id. at p. 1314.)”</div><div>Melchoir, at 793.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, in Lectrodryer v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 723, 726, the Second District affirmed a trial court judgment based on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff, determining:</div><div>“Evidence also supported the conclusion that Lectrodryer satisfied the elements for a claim of unjust enrichment: receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. (First Nationwide Savings v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662-1663 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 173].).”</div><div>Lectrodryer, at 726.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Second District accordingly recognized an independent unjust enrichment cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>There is some disagreement concerning the existence of such a stand-alone cause of action in California.&nbsp; In fact, in Wilder v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA (2009) 2009 U.S. Lexis&nbsp; 124242, a federal district court criticized the broad holding that such a cause of action is not recognized in California, summarizing the conflicting authorities on this issue as follows:</div><div>“Defendant urges the Court to dismiss this claim based on the argument that there is no unjust enrichment cause of action in California as a matter of law.&nbsp; California courts have provided conflicting direction as to whether a separate cause of action exists for unjust enrichment. Some courts have held as an absolute that no such cause of action exists in California. See Melchior v. New Line Prod., Inc., 1601 Cal. App. 4th 779,793,131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347 (Cal Ct. App. 2003)("[t]here is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment"); Jogani v. Superior Court, 165 Cal. App. 4th 901, 911, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 503 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004). However, other various courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have held just the opposite. See, e.g., Western Pac. R. Corp. v. Western Pac. R. Co., 206 F.2d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 1953) ("it is of course true that the California courts, in common with authorities generally, recognize a cause of action based on unjust enrichment"); Gerlinger v.Amazon.com, Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 838, 856 (N.D. Cal. 2004) ("[u]nder California law, unjust enrichment is an action in quasi-contract") (citing Paracor Fin. v. Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 96 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 1996)); Nordberg v. Trilegiant Corp., 445 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (courts holding that no cause of action for unjust enrichment exists have focused on semantic arguments; cause of action for unjust enrichment can be understood as a proper and valid cause of action for restitution); F.D.I.C. v. Dintino, 167 Cal. App. 4th 333, 346, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 38 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (upholding unjust enrichment cause of action). The Court finds that the weight of authority indicates that California law recognizes a cause of action for unjust enrichment/restitution.”</div><div>Wilder at 124242.</div><div><br></div><div>Given the split of authority, and the practice of the courts of appeal in evaluating an unjust enrichment cause of action as a claim for restitution, this court is reluctant to at the pleading stage to sustain a demurrer on the ground the cause of action is not a recognized cause of action.

It is also alleged that defendant took various steps to conceal the 24 hour gym, by providing a separate entrance in the back of the unit, causing the gym equipment to be delivered in the middle of the night, and entering into an arrangement with the operator of the gym without a written agreement for sublease, occupancy, or operation of the gym, so that there would be no paper trail.&nbsp;

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, defendant as cross-complainant intends to allege that defendant agreed to lease additional space which adjoined his original unit and shared the same entrance room, with the understanding that defendant could sublease the additional space, because it would be easier for defendant than for plaintiff to seek out and arrange a subtenancy for an adjoining business, and that with the advance permission of defendant, then being run by Paul Barsamian, defendant subleased the space to a third party, Jaime Aviles, for personal training and one-on-one training and exercise sessions for Aviles’ clients.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant intends to allege that in September of 2023, Paul Barsamian informed defendant he wanted to retire, and that Daron Barsamian would be taking over management and operation of the subject property, and that thereafter Daron Barsamian informed defendant he was not allowing any sublease of the unit, as a result of which defendant requested that Aviles vacate the premises, with defendant paying Aviles to help him move out, but nevertheless, plaintiff demanded that defendant also vacate the subject premises, and ultimately filed this lawsuit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since the proposed cross-complaint is directed at a party who filed the complaint against defendant, the cross-complaint should have been filed before or at the same time as the answer, but was not filed with the answer, which was filed on March 12, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As argued by defendant, this is a compulsory cross-complaint.&nbsp; Under CCP § 426.30 (a):</div><div>“Except as otherwise provided by statute, if a party against whom a complaint has been filed and served fails to allege in a cross-complaint any related cause of action which (at the time of serving his answer to the complaint) he has against the plaintiff, such party may not thereafter in any other action assert against the plaintiff the related cause of action not pleaded.”</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 426.50, the court may grant relief from this failure by permitting leave to file or amend a cross-complaint:&nbsp;</div><div>“A party who fails to plead a cause of action subject to the requirements of this article, whether through inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause, may apply to the court for leave ...to file a cross-complaint, to assert such cause at any time during the course of the action.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court, after notice to the adverse party, shall grant, upon such terms as may be just to the parties, leave to ...file the cross- complaint if the party who failed to plead the cause acted in good faith.&nbsp; This subdivision shall be liberally construed to avoid forfeiture of causes of action.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In order to deny the filing of a pleading or amended pleading in such a case, the trial court must find that substantial evidence supports a finding that the moving party acted in bad faith.&nbsp; Silver Organization, Ltd v. Frank, (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 97-99.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the proposed cross-complaint sets forth causes of action against plaintiff which arise out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences as the case brought against defendant, as both plaintiff’s complaint and defendant’s proposed cross-complaint relate to alleged breaches of the subject lease and any interpretation of the lease.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues he has acted in good faith here, as defendant did not file a cross-complaint earlier as he honestly believed that the parties could have settled the matter, but that during settlement negotiations, plaintiff continued to act in bad faith and engage in tortious conduct.&nbsp; Defendant also indicates that the case is relatively new, a trial date has not been set, so plaintiff will have sufficient time to investigate and conduct discovery on the cross claims.&nbsp; Defendant also indicates that other than written discovery propounded by plaintiff, no other discovery has been completed, and no depositions have been taken.&nbsp; Defendant also argues that the cross claims proposed are all brought within the applicable statutes of limitations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that there is substantial evidence in this case that bad faith exists, arguing that defendant’s intent is to bring frivolous claims, attack plaintiff’s protected activities and disrupt and suppress plaintiff’s rights.&nbsp; The argument appears to be primarily that the proposed cross-complaint pertains to plaintiff initiating and exercising legal rights and rights to petition once plaintiff discovered defendant’s allegedly egregious misconduct as a tenant.&nbsp; The opposition then argues essentially that plaintiff’s version of events is undeniable and supported by evidence, and that it is clear defendant’s intent in bringing the cross-complaint is to lessen his liability.&nbsp; If this were the standard for a finding of bad faith, virtually every cross-complaint would be motivated by bad faith.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear that the allegations defendant has asserted are frivolous, as many of the allegations appear somewhat consistent with the account of events in the complaint. To the extent defendant wants to pursue the position that the cross-complaint is an attempt to interfere with plaintiff’s rights to petition, or are insufficiently stated, or are knowingly not based in good faith on facts, or that defendant has destroyed evidence relevant to this case, plaintiff may pursue such positions on their merits in appropriate procedures after the cross-complaint is permitted to be filed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition actually supports the argument in the moving papers that plaintiff’s delay in seeking to file the compulsory cross-complaint was due to defendant’s belief that the matter would be resolved by settlement, as the declaration in opposition details settlement discussions taking before and&nbsp; up to the end of April, 2024, and the beginning of May, 2024.&nbsp; [Barsamian Decl., paras. 19-23].&nbsp; &nbsp;Although counsel’s failure to timely file a cross-complaint for this reason may be characterized as neglectful on the part of counsel, it does not rise to the level of bad faith.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;In fact, the court of appeal in Silver Organizations expressly held that where the cross-complaint is compulsory, factors such as the sufficiency of any mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect alone are not sufficient:</div><div>“The legislative mandate is clear. A policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes of action is imposed on the trial court. A motion to file a cross-complaint at any time during the course of the action must be granted unless bad faith of the moving party is demonstrated where forfeiture would otherwise result. Factors such as oversight, inadvertence, neglect, mistake or other cause, are insufficient grounds to deny the motion unless accompanied by bad faith.”</div><div>Silver Organizations, at 98-99.&nbsp;</div><div>Here, the opposition does not establish circumstances suggesting bad faith, and this circumstance is not a situation where defendant will have obtained any strategic advantage by the delay in seeking very early on in the litigation to formalize these defenses in case affirmative relief against the complaint is warranted.&nbsp; There is no substantial evidence supporting a finding of bad faith, as required.&nbsp; See Silver Organizations, at 99 (holding in connection with a bad faith finding, “it is our view that substantial evidence must support the trial court’s decision.” (italics in original)).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Overall, this is a compulsory cross-complaint, and if it is not permitted to be filed there would be a forfeiture of defendant’s affirmative claims against plaintiff.&nbsp; In addition, even if the cross-complaint were not compulsory, the court has a strong interest in having all claims determined together, rather than having defendant file a separate action, which may ultimately be consolidated with this action in the future, while the time would be better spent moving forward in discovery and addressing the merits of the parties’ claims.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion is granted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendant Vardan Stambulyan’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant and Cross-Complainant Vardan Stambulyan is ordered to efile a separate signed copy of the cross-complaint submitted as Exhibit A, deleting the “Proposed” designation, by close of business this date and the cross-complaint will be deemed served on the current parties as of the efiling of the pleading.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 24NNCV00708&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  July 19, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>8<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>7/19/2024&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>24 NNCV00708<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Trial Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Raner v.

Raner brings this case for partition of real property, an apartment building in Pasadena, alleging that plaintiff is the owner of an undivided one-fourth (25%) tenant-in-common interests in the property, and that defendant John K. Stumpus is an owner of an undivided three-fourths (75%) tenant-in-common interest in the property.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff and defendant are cousins who acquired their interests in the property through common relatives, and that after defendant acquired interest in the property, plaintiff entrusted him with management of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The verified complaint alleges that defendant has failed to properly manage the property, failing to collect rents at fair market value for several units and neglecting to accurately record the property’s income and expenses, and not providing information on accounting related to the property to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the parties do not communicate well and have been unable to reach an agreement to divide the property, leaving plaintiff with no option other than to undertake this action for the parties’ common benefit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges one cause of action for partition, and seeks allowance, accounting, contribution or any compensatory adjustments among the parties according to equity, an interlocutory judgment, appointment of a partition referee and receiver, an order of disbursement, a writ of possession, and attorneys’ fees and experts’ and referees’ expenses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Stumpus, individually and as successor trustee of the Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust, has filed a verified answer to the complaint, responding to each paragraph of the complaint, and alleging thirteen affirmative defenses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Under CCP section 430.30, an objection may be taken by demurrer to a pleading, “[w]hen any ground for objection to” an “answer appears on the face thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial notice…”</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 430.20 provides:</div><div>“A party against whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer as provided in Section 430.30, to the answer upon any one or more of the following grounds:</div><div>(a)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense.</div><div>(b)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The answer is uncertain.&nbsp; As used in this subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible.</div><div>(c)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Where the answer pleads a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the answer whether the contract is written or oral.”</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Raner initially argues that in a partition action, the law requires that the defendant specifically allege the status of defendant’s&nbsp; interest in the property, but defendant has failed to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 872.410, which provides, in pertinent part, with respect for civil actions for partition of real and personal property:&nbsp;</div><div>“The answer shall set forth:</div><div>(a)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Any interest the defendant has or claims in the property.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that defendant is required to set up in his own pleading the nature and extent of his interest in the property, and that an allegation that plaintiff and defendant are owners of the property fails to state the proportionate interest being claimed by defendant.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in opposition argues that the answer sufficiently alleges defendant’s position that plaintiff no longer holds any interest in the property, as in paragraph 4 of the answer, defendant alleges that “title is vested in the trustee to the Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust U/D/T Dated Septemver 10, 2007 (see Exhibit E to the Verified Partition Complaint)”&nbsp; [Answer, para. 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that a review of that document, Exhibit E to the Complaint, which supersedes any allegations of the complaint to which it is attached to the extent the allegations are inconsistent, shows that title is in fact held in that matter.&nbsp; The document is a Guarantee of Condition of Title issued by First American Title on March 8, 2024, and states:</div><div>“According to the Public Records as of the Date of Guarantee,&nbsp;</div><div>a.&nbsp; Title to the estate or interest in the Land is vested in:&nbsp;</div><div>Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus, as Trustees of The Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust, U/D/T Dated September 10, 2007, Subject to Exception No. 5.”</div><div>[Complaint, Ex.

Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 484, in which the court of appeal observed,&nbsp; “A co-owner of property has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid waiver.”&nbsp; &nbsp;LEG Investments, at 493.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, as noted above, defendant here is taking the position that plaintiff is not a co-owner of the property, so that the right to partition is in issue here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, Miller and Starr recognize that:</div><div>“Partition is a matter of absolute right and in the absence of waiver or estoppel or other equitable defenses, each co-tenant in ownership has the right to petition for partition of the common property.”</div><div>Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.)&nbsp; § 40:126, emphasis added.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also a discussion in Miller &amp; Starr with respect to defenses to partition, in which it is observed:</div><div>“Equitable defenses. The element of unfairness that precludes an absolute right of partition under various circumstances often results from the fact that a court ordered sale of the property in a partition action is a sale of the entire interest in the property and not merely a sale of the individual interests of the co-owners. The sale becomes a “forced sale” in the same sense as a foreclosure sale or a sale under execution. The objecting co-owner is thereby required to part with his or her interest in the property contrary to his or her expectations. Because an action for partition is an equitable proceeding, this hardship on the defendant cotenant has induced the courts to modify the absolute right of partition by certain equitable defenses such as waiver of the right of partition, estoppel, or other conditions that make the equitable principle of fairness applicable.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Unfairness as a defense to partition. “[I]n addition to the limitation on the right of partition derived from the express or implied waiver by agreement, the courts have imposed an even wider and more general limitation. This limitation subjects the right of partition to the ‘requirements of fairness.’”</div><div><br></div><div>Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.)&nbsp; § 11:20, footnotes omitted, italics in the original, quoting American Medical International, Inc. v. Feller (1976) 59 Cal. App. 3d 1008, 1015.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in opposition also points out that the cause of action for partition as alleged in the verified complaint seeks various equitable remedies, such as an accounting, which claims would fairly be subject to equitable defenses.&nbsp; [Complaint, prayer, paras. A-E].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the first cause of action for failure to state a cause of action affirmative defense is inadequate as a matter of a law, as it is merely a general denial, which is prohibited in response to a verified complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that under California statutory law, this is a valid objection to a pleading.&nbsp; As defendant points out in the opposition, under CCP Section 430.80, the defense is expressly designated a valid objection which cannot be waived even if a party fails to timely assert it:</div><div>“(b) If the party against whom an answer has been filed fails to demur thereto, that party is deemed to have waived the objection unless it is an objection that the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense.”</div><div><br></div><div>Since this defense cannot be waived even if not asserted, it evidently can be asserted in an answer, and need not be alleged with any particularity.&nbsp; In Stevens v. Torregano (1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 105, the court of appeal expressly observed:</div><div>“[T]he point that a complaint does not state a cause of action is never waived.&nbsp; The point may be raised by answer, and it is not improper to do so, even though a previous demurer on the same ground has been overruled.”</div><div>Stevens, at 112, citations omitted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the first affirmative defense and the fourth through twelfth affirmative defenses, which are equitable defenses, are not sufficiently specifically pled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1993) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, in which the court of appeal affirmed the granting of a motion for summary judgment, in part on the ground that the conclusory affirmative defenses stated in defendants’ answer were insufficient to place facts in issue.&nbsp;</div><div>“All of the allegations are proffered in the form of terse&nbsp;</div><div>legal conclusions, rather than as facts "averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint." (See Pomeroy, Code Remedies, supra, at 563, at p. 917.) The only affirmative defenses that are mentioned in the summary judgment proceedings,</div><div>fraud in the inducement and failure of consideration, are not well pled, consisting of legal conclusions, and would not have survived a demurrer. (See e.g.,&nbsp; &nbsp;Metropolis etc. Sav. Bank v. Monnier (1915) 169 Cal. 592, 596 [147 P. 265] (Metropolis);&nbsp; Riegel v.
