(Beckman Coulter), serviced a piece of laboratory equipment at a laboratory located at the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) and while so doing negligently allowed the equipment’s laser to shine through an open door into a highly-trafficked hallway, where it struck plaintiff in the eye, rendering permanent ocular damage.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff was working at the Cal Tech laboratories as a research technician, and was at the time walking within a hallway of Elowitz Laboratory where Luong was aligning the lasers of a CytoFlex Flow Cytometer inside a room within the Elowitz Laboratory, when defendant allowed the Cytometer’s laser array to shine into the hallway by leaving the door open to the room housing the Cytometer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that the Cytometer was owned and controlled by defendant Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), which had an actual employer-employee relationship with defendant Michael B. Elowitz, and that the Elowitz Laboratory was used, at least in part, to perform research commissioned by HHMI.</div><div><br></div><div>The operative complaint, the Second Amended Complaint, alleges causes of action for negligence, negligent hiring/training/supervision of defendant Luong, strict product liability, vicarious liability, and loss of consortium.&nbsp; The loss of consortium claim is brought by plaintiff Emmeline Calvert, the spouse of plaintiff Colby Calvert.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on November 30, 2023, plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal of the action with prejudice as to defendants Michael B.

Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 396, in which the Second District affirmed the trial court’s granting of a motion for nonsuit in favor of defendant pharmaceutical company in a case where plaintiff had claimed her cancer was caused by the ingestion of defendant’s contraceptive drug.&nbsp; The Second District observed:</div><div>“The law is well settled that in a personal injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based upon competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to establish a prima facie case. ( Morgenroth v. Pacific Medical Center, Inc., supra, at p. 533; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Johnston v. Brother (1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 464, 473 [12 Cal.Rptr. 23]; Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 162, 165 [5 Cal.Rptr. 738].) That there is a distinction between a reasonable medical "probability" and a medical "possibility" needs little discussion. There can be many possible "causes," indeed, an infinite number of circumstances which can produce an injury or disease. A possible cause only becomes "probable" when, in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations, it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of its action. This is the outer limit of inference upon which an issue may be submitted to the jury. (See Parker v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. of Wis.

D, P.E., CLSO, an expert in product design and safety of optical/optoelectronic devices, including lasers and the device at issue here.&nbsp; [Lau Decl., para. 2].&nbsp; Lau explains that based on the safety features of the machine at issue, a Cyto FLEX S instrument, his own experiments on an exemplar of the instrument, and the accounts of plaintiff and defendant Luong which eliminate the possibility of any reflective object being in the vicinity while the instrument was being serviced, Dr. Lau has concluded that there was no reflective object which was the cause of plaintiff Calvert’s claimed exposure to laser lights.&nbsp; [Lau Decl., paras. 3-10, 15].&nbsp; Lau further opines that any observed light would have been non-hazardous, and that during the servicing of the machine, if any collimated beam of light had exited the boundaries of the instrument, the beam of light would have remained in an optical plane less than four feet above the ground, so that Mr. Calvert, who is between five feet nine and five feet eleven in height, would have had to have taken an overt action, such an intentional squat, to place his eyes into the optical plane.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Lau Decl., paras. 13, 15].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Lau testifies:</div><div>“In summary, I hold the following opinions to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty: (1) no hazardous laser light exited the boundaries of the CytoFLEX S instrument when Mr. Calvert alleges to have been exposed to lasers; (2) if Mr. Calvert was exposed to laser light, it was nonhazardous residual light that cannot cause injury;… (5) if, hypothetically, hazardous laser light (e.g., any collimated beam of light) exited the boundaries of the instrument, the light would have remained in an optical plane less than four feet above the floor and absent an overt action to lower the height of his eyes, any collimated beam of light would not have hit Mr. Calvert’s eyes.”</div><div>[Lau Decl., para. 15].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also argue that plaintiffs will be unable to establish medical causation here because plaintiff Colby Calvert has no evidence that he suffered a laser induced optical injury, but has had numerous Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans performed on his retina, none of which show symptoms or damage consistent with a laser injury.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants rely on the expert declaration of Alredo Sadun, M.D., Ph.D., who is a licensed physician and surgeon board certified in ophthalmology, with a specialty in neuro ophthalmology, who explains the recognized methods for verifying a laser-induced optical injury:</div><div>“6.&nbsp; A laser-induced optical injury is objectively verifiable by direct observation and by diagnostic testing.&nbsp; Specifically, a laser induced optical injury will immediately produce symptoms and damage the portions of the retina which was impacted by the laser and the burn becomes evident within a day.&nbsp; A very specific spot of damage to the retina will visible [sic] on direct observation by a variety of optical methods, by fundus photograph and, most sensitive of all, by Optical Coherence Tomography (‘OCT’) scan.&nbsp; The OCT can provide three-dimensional analysis of any retinal damage resolvable down to the 10 micron level.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>7.&nbsp; The OCT is currently the gold standard for identifying the existence of a laser injury.&nbsp; If a patient does not have any spot of damage—which would be a retinal burn mark or secondary damage such as swelling—the patient does not have a laser injury.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>8.&nbsp; Visible lasers, particularly single lasers with power output of 100 mW or less, or multiple separate lasers of similar power output, cannot damage any part of the body other than the eye.&nbsp; There is no reliable medical literature that supports the existence of a laser injury in the absence of any evidence on an OCT demonstrating a spot of damage as identified in paragraph 7 (above).”&nbsp;</div><div>[Sadun, Decl., paras.&nbsp; 6-8].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Dr. Sadun goes on to report the results of his own examination of plaintiff Colby Calvert, as well as his review of the medical records of other examining healthcare providers:</span></div><div>“9.&nbsp; On May 23, 2023, I performed a direct fundus examination on Mr. Calvert and found no laser scar in the retina.&nbsp; Additionally, I performed an OCT.&nbsp; The scan showed healthy-looking optic nerve heads and maculae, and normal nerve fiber layer.&nbsp; &nbsp;In short, there was no damage to the retina and no indication of any laser injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>10.&nbsp; I have also reviewed the results of OCTs performed by other healthcare providers.&nbsp; These include scans performed by Michelle Sato, M.D., Swaraj Bose, M.D., Jonathan Macy, M.D., Daniel Su, M.D., and Carl Garbus, OD.&nbsp; I either reviewed the OCTs or reports thereof, none of which identified anything indicative of a laser injury to the retina.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Sadun Decl., paras. 9, 10].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Dr. Sadun also indicates that had plaintiff truly been injured by lasers from the subject instrument, his symptoms would consist not of positive visual phenomena, like the swirling colors and smearing vertical lines plaintiff has described to his treating physicians, but negative visual phenomenon, such as a dark patch or hole in his vision.&nbsp; [Sadun Decl., para. 11].&nbsp; Dr. Sadun concludes concerning plaintiff Colby Calvert:</span></div><div>“I conclude to a degree reasonable medical probability that he did not suffer any injury to his retina from the Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX S laser because said injury has not been born out either by expected reported symptomology or relevant diagnostic testing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>12.&nbsp; To a reasonable degree of medical probability Mr. Calvert has not suffer [sic] any laser-induced optical injury.”</div><div>[Sadun Decl., paras. 11, 12].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The showing presented does not clearly meet defendants’ burden on the issue of whether there was in fact an incident involving plaintiff Colby Calvert experiencing exposure to laser lights on the date in question, as the moving papers submit deposition testimony from plaintiff in which he reports repeatedly that when he walked by the room where the cytometer was kept, the door was open, it looked like the cytometer was open with the safety cover off, and plaintiff saw four lights which appeared to be lasers, at his eye level, to which he was exposed for an estimated two minutes. [Campodonico Decl., para. 3, Ex. B, Calvert Depo. pp.&nbsp; 65-76].&nbsp; &nbsp;The deposition testimony also appears to report that after plaintiff believes he was exposed he had trouble with his vision, similar to having stared at the sun for too long, but was still able to see well enough to work his protocols he was working on for his work.&nbsp; [Calvert Depo., p. 76].&nbsp; This appears to be the type of negative symptomology, impeding his vision, which defendants’ expert indicates would have been suffered had plaintiff suffered an injury to his retina from a laser exposure.&nbsp; The testimony supports a competing reasonable inference that plaintiff suffered laser exposure and experienced symptoms of injury from such exposure based on plaintiff’s description of his visual symptoms alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 437c(c) provides that “summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or evidence that raise a triable issue as to any material fact.”&nbsp; &nbsp;See also Hepp v.

Bondi (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 346, 354.&nbsp; There is more than one reasonable conclusion to be reached on the showing on this issue of whether exposure occurred, and the motion on this issue is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even if defendants’ showing were sufficient to shift the burden, plaintiff in opposition has addressed these issues, as discussed below.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The initial showing is sufficient to satisfy defendants’ initial burden on the issue of causation, which in this context requires expert testimony.&nbsp; The court finds that the showing is sufficient to shift the burden to plaintiff to raise triable issues of material fact.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs in opposition argue that defendants are mistaken that there are no disputed facts to establish general and specific causation.&nbsp; Plaintiffs argues that there are disputed material facts which demonstrate that even if a collimated beam of laser light did not escape the cytometer, diffuse laser radiation undoubtedly did escape, exposing plaintiff Colby Calvert to a diffuse light spraying from the machine, which is just as dangerous to the human eye as a beam itself, and contentions about plaintiff’s precise height and the height of the machine are of no moment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also argue that as to specific causation, plaintiffs have submitted expert testimony from Dr. David Scales, M.D. which establishes both behavioral findings and objective test results consistent with the presence of laser eye injuries in Colby Calvert’s eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the issue of plaintiff Colby Calvert’s claimed exposure to laser lights in his eyes, an issue which arguably remains in issue based on defendants’ submission of plaintiff’s deposition testimony, plaintiff further submits the expert declaration of expert Ashraf&nbsp; Eldakouri, Ph. D, a senior laser engineer with a master of science in applied physics and a Ph. D in laser physics. Eldakouri has worked in laser optics since 1998, and has experience in the design, construction, testing, calibration and operation of lasers and laser systems for a variety of diverse applications, including for medical, research and commercial purposes.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., paras. 1-15].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Eldakouri has reviewed the relevant materials pertaining to this case, including the pertinent depositions and declarations, photographs of the subject machine, videos and photographs of the site inspection, product manuals, electrical ratings and descriptions of maintenance protocols.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Eldakouri Decl., para. 19].&nbsp; The expert explains that in determining whether it was possible given the location and condition of the cytometer on the date of the incident that plaintiff saw bright lights and suffered a laser exposure with radiation in excess of the minimum threshold for eye injury, Dr. Eldakouri calculated the path of travel of any beam and diffuse radiation, and quantified the amount of energy that would have been transmitted during exposure.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., para. 28-30].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Eldakouri explains his processes, indicates that there is no dispute that on the date of the incident the maintenance being performed indicates the cytoflex unit was powered on, the protective shielding was removed, and the safety interlock feature was disabled, meaning the four class 3B lasers were powered on, and that the circumstances are consistent with diffuse or scattering laser radiation produced as a result of reflection from the dichromic mirrors within the machine.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., paras. 35-36].&nbsp; The declaration explains that the subject machine has multiple warnings concerning eye damage, particularly where the protective housing has been removed, quoting those warnings and illustrative labels, and also explains that:</div><div>“Diffuse radiation is in many circumstances just as dangerous as direct beam radiation, and in some ways more so as it does not travel in a straight, predictable path. Instead, it spreads out in all directions as it travels from its point of origin. This makes it much more likely to contact a person’s eyes, as it did here, or interact with other reflective surfaces nearby, resulting in yet more unpredictable reflections and exposures.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Eldakouri Decl., paras. 37-40].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is further explained that diffuse radiation does not travel in a tight controlled beam, but in this case predictably sprayed in a cloud toward the hallway, and also upward, straight above the machine, where there was a series of three shelves built directly above the machine at its location in the laboratory, which had been polished to a smooth surface, and set at an angle slightly more than an angle parallel to the ground.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., paras. 41-48].&nbsp; This testimony is in contradiction to the expert testimony offered by defendants, which depends on the fact that there was no reflective surface in the room or on the person of defendant Luong which would have refracted any laser beams.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Eldakouri states his opinions:</div><div>“49.&nbsp; In this case, it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty that on February 23, 2019, while the Cytoflex flow cytometer was powered on, and the protective housing was removed, and the safety interlocked was defeated, as Hung Luong stated, that diffuse laser radiation emitted from the reflection of the four Class 3B lasers in the Cytoflex unit from the dichromic mirrors, travelled outward from the exposed optical bench, to the hallway where Mr. Calvert was walking, but also to the underside of the shelving situated directly above the machine, and reflected at a myriad of varying angles, again, into the hallway, where the door to the room housing the machine was left open by the technician servicing the machine. Once in the hallway, it struck Mr. Calvert’s eyes, resulting in his describing seeing multicolored lasers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>50. I cannot agree that diffuse radiation from class 3B lasers (especially four of them firing at varying wavelengths and intensities) constitutes nothing more than “harmless light”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>51. In fact, attached hereto as Exh. “1” is a copy of the commonly accepted methodology utilized by optical engineers for computing diffuse laser radiation iridescence.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>52. Additionally, I have provided analyses and computations performed by myself in this case, using the above-described theorems, factors, and methodologies, taking into account the powers and wavelengths of the lasers at issue in this case, as well as the distances involved, and other factors and I have calculated that in Mr. Calvert’s case, based on the power and wavelengths of the lasers present in the CytoFlex S on the date of the incident, Mr. Calvert’s eyes were exposed to diffuse radiation from the CytoFlex S machine and each of his eyes would have been exposed to reflective irradiance equal to approximately 210.18 mW/cm2. [Calculations are attached as Exh. “2” hereto.]&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>53. The usual “safe” irradiance at the retina of a human eye for long-term exposure is .29 mW/cm2.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>54. In other words, Mr. Calvert’s exposure levels in each eye as a result of diffuse radiation from the Cytoflex S machine on the date of the incident were slightly less than one thousand times the level that is considered safe to the human eye, and were sustained over the course of approximately two seconds, according to his testimony.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>55. Thus, the diffuse laser exposure that Mr. Calvert’s eyes sustained on February 23, 2019, exceeded the threshold at which injury to a human eye is known to occur.”</div><div>[Eldakouri Decl., paras. 49-55, italics in the original].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The expert explains that it was improper to leave the door open during the maintenance period, exposing third parties to unnecessary contact with laser beams, contrary to the warnings on the machine.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., paras. 32-33, 37, 38].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also submits the declaration of another expert, Jamie Tijerina,&nbsp; a specialist in flow cytometry, who is employed as faculty at Cal Tech at the Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility, who routinely works with Beckman Coulter CytoFlex S in day-to-day work, has reviewed the appropriate materials, and opines that rooms that house instruments such as the subject instrument should have signage indicating the presence of lasers at all times, when no such signage was in place, and that such an instrument should be kept behind a closed door or with a shade placed to protect personnel passing by.&nbsp; [Tijerina Decl., paras.&nbsp; 2-15].&nbsp; The expert also explains the mechanics of the instrument’s release of diffuse radiation when being serviced, and opines, “Based on the description by Mr. Calvert about what he visualized on the date of the incident, he was exposed to diffuse radiation from 4 class 3B lasers emanating from the Beckman Coulter CytoFlex S as he stood in the hallway of the Elowitz laboratory.”&nbsp; [Tijerina Decl., para. 17].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>These declarations are each independently sufficient to raise triable issues of material fact with respect to whether plaintiff in fact experienced exposure to laser light which was of a sufficient level to injure plaintiff’s eyes.&nbsp; Accordingly, even if the burden had shifted to plaintiffs here to raise triable issues of material fact on this issue, that burden has been met.

The instrument is equipped with an external system cover, a front panel, and an optical bench cover which serve as primary shielding. When the optical bench cover is removed, for example, during the process of laser alignment, the laser lights immediately power down via an interlock. The interlock can be disabled by an interlock defeat tool with an interlock defeat pin. Thereafter, the lasers can be turned on but additional shielding keeps the primary laser beam contained within the instrument. These additional shielding components consist of the dichroic mirrors, printed circuit boards, and the turning mirror. The dichroic mirrors, the printed circuit boards, and the turning mirror are additional mechanisms that prevent the primary laser beams from exiting the boundaries of the instrument.”</div><div>[Lau Decl., para. 6].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Lau also indicates that he conducted experiments on an exemplar instrument substantially equivalent to the subject instrument, which could be interpreted as indicating that accessible emissions did in fact occur, which somewhat undermines the testimony that no laser beam exited.&nbsp; Dr. Lau nevertheless testifies that:</span></div><div>“By design any laser light exiting the boundaries of the instrument would consist of diverging, non-collimated light. Therefore, the laser light between the optical bench area and 6 feet away would follow the inverse-square law of diverging sources and decrease in irradiance the farther the observer is from the laser origin. Hence, any observed light between these two points and any observed light farther than 6 feet away would also be non-hazardous.”</div><div>[Lau Decl., para. 9].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also relies on Dr. Lau’s opinion, discussed above, that any laser light that did escape would have been diffused or collimated, unless “via the placement of a foreign specularly reflective object into the primary beam pathway,” so would not be harmful, or would have not been directed at plaintiff’s eyes but at a lower point on his body.&nbsp; [Lau Decl., paras. 10-12].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As discussed above, plaintiffs’ experts have offered testimony concerning those opinions which raise triable issues of material fact concerning the dangerousness of the release of diffused laser light, as well as the probable diversion of that light off a reflective shelf in the laboratory.&nbsp; [Eldakouri Decl., paras. 2, 27-55; Tijerina Decl., paras. 10-13, 17].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, plaintiffs’ experts in opposition to the motion also express opinions that the instrument was defectively designed, as during maintenance the Cytoflex unit was powered on, the protective shielding was removed, and the safety interlock feature was disabled, so that the four powerful lasers were powered on, producing diffuse or scattering hazardous laser radiation as a result, in violation of fundamental tenants of laser safety, and that harmful diffuse or scattered laser radiation emanates from dichroic mirror arrays in the subject instrument when the protective housing is removed upon bypassing interlocks.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Eldakouri Decl., para. 34-36; Tijerina Decl., para. 12., see also, photos submitted at Tijerina Decl., paras, 13, 17].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Triable issues of fact have been raised with respect to whether the subject instrument was defectively designed, causing the release of lasers during maintenance, and in turn causing plaintiff Colby Calvert’s injuries.&nbsp; The motion on this cause of action accordingly is denied.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in reply argues that plaintiffs have not in opposition to the motion addressed the issue of defect, but focus primarily on the negligence- based claims, essentially abandoning any product liability claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP § 437c (c)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div>“(c) The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

Based on the resultant understanding of the origin, nature, and severity of any mental state difficulties/impairments, it is then feasible to formulate prognoses and, if applicable, future treatment needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The clinical interview covers a variety of relevant topics, including background information; the reported circumstances of onset of the alleged mental state injury or injuries; and how those symptoms have unfolded over time to the present, including any other assessments, treatment, or functional impairment. A detailed evaluation of this type is important in differentiating between mental state injuries/complaints that may be pre-existing and not related to the alleged actions of the defendant; injuries/complaints that were pre-existing but may have been exacerbated by the alleged actions of defendant; injuries/complaints that arose concurrently but unrelated to alleged actions of defendant; complaints that arose as a result of defendant’s alleged conduct; complaints that are actually due to substance use or medications; complaints that are due to an underlying general medical disorder; or complaints that arose subsequent to the alleged actions of defendant and were unrelated.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pertinent areas of inquiry with regard to plaintiff’s background include developmental history, education, employment, social and marital history, legal history, e.g., disability claims, general medical history, mental health history, substance use, and family history. The clinical interview also will elicit from plaintiff a detailed account of the onset and course of his/her mental state problems/impairments related to the alleged conduct of the defendants, culminating in a review of current mental state and physical complaints. Plaintiff also will be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests. The tests are considered to be valid and reliable measures of cognition and emotion, and will assess the following domains: intellectual function, attention/information processing speed, language/academic achievement, visuospatial skills, motoric function, memory for auditory and/or visual information, executive/frontal function, and/or personality/emotional functioning. Plaintiff may take an unlimited number of breaks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The mental state evaluation will not involve any physical examination. There will be no blood tests or other intrusive or protracted medical studies or procedures. The examination will be conducted at the following location: 11835 Olympic Blvd., Suite 1270E, Los Angeles, CA 90064, unless other arrangements are made with respect to the location of the IME.

(Kalechstein Decl. ¶ 9.) The specific tests that Dr. Kalechstein will administer will be determined once the testing has commenced. (Id.) Given what Dr. Kalechstein understands about the instant case and Plaintiff’s injuries/complaints, he has estimated that the mental, emotional, cognitive, and personality-based testing, including the interview portion of the examination, will be completed in full in under six (6) hours. (Id.) This expected testing by Dr. Kalechstein is both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, as Plaintiff already voluntarily underwent 24 tests by her own neuro-psychologist Dr. Grewal.</div><div>[Memorandum, pp. 4-6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This information is not included in the notice of motion.&nbsp; The information also does not clearly establish the qualifications of the examiner. Under CCP section 2032.020 (c)(1):</div><div>“A mental examination conducted under this chapter shall be performed only by a licensed physician, or by a licensed clinical psychologist who holds a doctoral degree in psychology and has had at least five years of postgraduate experience in the diagnosis of emotional and mental disorders.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The information provided does not permit the court to confirm that the proposed examiner meets these requirements, particularly that the examiner has at least five years of the required experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that the description in the memorandum is so broad it encompasses the whole universe of plaintiff’s humanity, including information with no direct relation to the matters at issue, and that it is unreasonable to expect plaintiff to respond to this broad request.&nbsp; Specifically, plaintiff argues that as a layperson, she should not be asked to remember or specify a medical history and should not be asked to give an oral history of the incident or provide a second unofficial deposition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on Golfland Entertainment Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 739, in which the court of appeal ordered issuance of a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate certain portions of its order in connection with a mental examination of plaintiff, in that case, a boy who allegedly suffered brain damage due to oxygen deprivation during a near-drowning while riding a bumper boat at defendant’s entertainment center.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal found that the trial court order had improperly ordered that the examining neuropsychologist “may take a history from DAVID NUNEZ but may not require or elicit narrative responses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal reviewed the trial court’s concerns, and concluded that an appropriate order would not broadly prohibit narrative responses, but that the trial court could properly order that the examiner “may take a history” from plaintiff, but,</div><div>“shall not ask [plaintiff] questions regarding the facts and circumstances of the accident to the extent those matters were already stated by [plaintiff] in his deposition or in his interview with Dr. Baumbach.”</div><div>Golfland, at 745-746.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The breadth of the examination as described in the memorandum makes it difficult to limit to the needs of this matter without some further specification by defendant as to what exactly will be pursued, so that a second examination does not become an unauthorized further deposition.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the court is also cognizant that it could in connection with this dispute issue an order that the examiner is simply prohibited from asking plaintiff questions regarding the facts and circumstances of the incident to the extent already stated in her deposition testimony.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also objects to the lack of notice with respect to which of the numerous listed tests and procedures will in fact be conducted, as the motion concedes that not all of them will be conducted and indicates that the specific tests to be pursued will be decided by the examiner during the course of the examination.&nbsp; &nbsp;This situation is of concern as the court is required to issue an order identifying the permissible diagnostic tests and procedures with specificity. Plaintiff cites Carpenter v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 249, in which the court of appeal observed:&nbsp;</div><div>“Requiring the court to identify the permissible diagnostic tests and procedures, by name, confirms that the court has weighed the risks of unwarranted intrusion upon the plaintiff against the defendant's need for a meaningful opportunity to test the plaintiff's claims of physical or mental injury. Furthermore, the resulting specificity and clarity of the order will also aid the examiner in understanding and complying with the parameters imposed by the court.</div><div><br></div><div>In sum, the plain meaning of section 2032.320 is that the trial court must “specify the ... diagnostic tests and procedures” of the mental examination by naming the tests and procedures to be performed.”</div><div>Carpenter, at 261-262, italics in the original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The information provided here is insufficient to permit the court to grant the relief requested or prepare the order with the detail required under CCP §§ 2032.310 (b) and 2032.320 (d).&nbsp; The motion could be denied without prejudice for failure to meet the procedural requirements of seeking the subject additional examination, but the court elects not to do so.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also argues that the motion is defective because it is not accompanied by a proposed order.&nbsp; &nbsp;CCP section 2032.320(d) provides:</span></div><div>“An order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Such an order is ordinarily submitted and served with the moving papers in connection with a motion under this section.&nbsp; The court has considered this issue and will not deny the motion without prejudice or continue this matter to ensure that all procedural requirements are met to obtain the relief requested.&nbsp; The only meritorious procedural deficiency is the lack of an order.&nbsp; Once defendant attorney submits a proposed order, the notice issues will be satisfied.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Substantive</div><div>If the procedural issues can be addressed or resolved at the hearing, the court now considers the merits of the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>By this motion, defendant Snow Joe seeks an order to allow defendant’s neuro-psychologist expert to conduct an independent medical examination of plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 2032.220, any defendant may demand one physical examination of plaintiff, “[i]n any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries...”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2032.020 (a) provides, in pertinent part: “Any party may obtain discovery, subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2019.010), by means of a physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action... in any action in which the mental...condition... of that party...is in controversy in the action.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant seeks relief under CCP section 2032.310 (a), which provides that if a second physical examination or mental examination is sought by any party, “the party shall obtain leave of court.”&nbsp; CCP § 2032.320 (a) provides that “The court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A showing of good cause generally requires the requesting party to show both relevancy to the subject matter, and specific facts justifying the discovery, in effect, specific facts showing the need for the information sought.

Superior Court (2010, 2nd Dist.) 184 Cal.App.4th 825, 843.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As explained by the California Supreme Court in Armendariz, this analysis requires a determination of whether an arbitration agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“We explained the judicially created doctrine of unconscionability in Scissor-Tail, supra, 28 Cal.3d 807.&nbsp; Unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion. (Id. at pp. 817-819.) “The term [contract of adhesion] signifies a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.” (Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos. (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 690, 694 [10 Cal.Rptr. 781].) If the contract is adhesive, the court must then determine whether “other factors are present which, under established legal rules-legislative or judicial-operate to render it [unenforceable].” (Scissor-Tail, supra, 28 Cal.3d at p. 820, fn. omitted.)”</div><div>Armendariz, at 113.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Court further explained the analysis as follows:</span></div><div>“As explained in A &amp; M Produce Co., supra, 135 Cal.App.3d 473, “unconscionability has both a 'procedural' and a 'substantive' element,” the former focusing on “ 'oppression' ” or “ 'surprise' ” due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on “ 'overly harsh' ” or “ 'one-sided' ” results. (Id. at pp. 486-487.) “The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1533 (Stirlen).) But they need not be present in the same degree. “Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.” (15 Williston on Contracts (3d ed. 1972) § 1763A, pp. 226-227; see also A &amp; M Produce Co., supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at p. 487.) In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.”</div><div>Armendariz, at 114, italics in the original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although Amendariz arose in the employment context, its analysis is not limited to that context.&nbsp; However, unlike in the employment context, where there is a presumption of unequal bargaining power and procedural unconscionability, outside the employment context, the party arguing that an arbitration provision is unconscionable must produce evidence of the parties’ bargaining power and circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement to show that transaction is tainted with surprise or oppression.&nbsp; Crippen v. Central Valley RV Outlet (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1162, 1164-1166.</div><div><br></div><div>As an initial matter, it would appear that plaintiffs’ procedural unconscionability argument is premised on the argument that the agreements were included in contracts of adhesion, as plaintiff argues that the purchase involved a pre-printed consumer sales contract presented to plaintiff as a “take it or leave it” agreement, and that plaintiff had no meaningful opportunity to negotiate with Tesla regarding any of the terms, except to reject arbitration of the described sales related claims.&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that if they wanted the Model Y vehicle, plaintiffs had to accept the contract as a whole.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First, plaintiffs have submitted no evidence of this with the opposition. The only evidence submitted is the declaration of counsel, who would have no personal knowledge concerning the negotiations, and who does not address the circumstances of plaintiffs entering into the agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>In any case, plaintiffs’ arguments are belied by the language of the agreement itself, and it does not appear that the agreement could be reasonably viewed as a contract of adhesion, where, as plaintiffs argue, plaintiffs were required to agree to arbitration or forego the opportunity to purchase the vehicle.&nbsp; Here, the express language of the agreement included in the Order Agreement permitted the purchaser to opt out of the arbitration agreement within 30 days of executing the Agreement by mailing a letter opting out to defendant at a stated address:</div><div>“You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days after signing this Agreement by sending a letter to: Tesla, Inc.; P.O. Box 15430; Fremont, CA 94539- 7970, stating your name, Vehicle Identification Number, and intent to opt out of the arbitration provision.

Francis Capital Management, LLC (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 676.&nbsp; In Lane, the Second District found that the trial court had erred in denying a motion to compel arbitration as to certain causes of action on the ground of unconscionability.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Second District rejected an argument that the failure to attach a copy of referenced AAA Rules was sufficient to establish procedural unconscionability:&nbsp;</div><div>“Here, we conclude the failure to attach a copy of the AAA rules did not render the agreement procedurally unconscionable. There could be no surprise, as the arbitration rules referenced in the agreement were easily accessible to the parties—the AAA rules are available on the Internet. (See Boghos v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (2005) 36 Cal.4th 495, 505, fn. 6, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 787, 115 P.3d 68 [full, up-to-date text of AAA rules is available on AAA's Internet site] ). In addition, Lane—a formerly well-paid professional analyst—does not appear to lack the means or capacity to locate and retrieve a copy of the referenced rules. Finally, the arbitration agreement at issue clearly specified a particular set of AAA rules, and it did not modify those rules in any manner. In the absence of oppression or surprise, we decline to find the failure to attach a copy of the AAA rules rendered the agreement procedurally unconscionable.”</div><div>Lane, at 691.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Here, the case similarly involves Rules easily accessible and here, the availability of the Rules on the internet, with a website, is expressly stated in the Agreement, the Agreement stating, “To learn more about the Rules and how to begin an arbitration, you may call any AAA office or go to www.adr.org.”&nbsp; [Kim Decl., Ex. 1, p. 4].&nbsp; The Agreement clearly specifies a particular set of AAA Rules, the “Consumer Arbitration Rules.”&nbsp; [Id].&nbsp; It would appear that the failure to attach the Rules themselves in these circumstances, particularly where there is no contract of adhesion, is not sufficient alone to establish procedural unconscionability.&nbsp; No procedural unconscionability at all has been shown.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, to establish unconscionability, both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be established.&nbsp; Since no procedural unconscionability is established here, the unconscionability argument fails, and the agreement is enforceable despite such an argument.&nbsp; Since no procedural unconscionability is established, the analysis need not proceed to consider if the arbitration agreements are substantively unconscionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Even if the court were to consider plaintiffs’ substantive unconscionability arguments, they would also fail.&nbsp; With respect to substantive unconscionability, the Second District has summarized substantive unconscionability as follows:</span></div><div>“Substantive unconscionability addresses the fairness of the term in dispute. Substantive unconscionability ‘traditionally involves contract terms that are so one-sided as to “shock the conscience,” or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.’ ” (Szetela v.

(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 638, 653-654, citations omitted.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs argue that the arbitration provision here does not provide for the selection of a true neutral arbitrator, as it provides that “The party electing arbitration may choose any of the following arbitration organization and its applicable rules.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The opposition sets forth this quote, without any citation, and it is not clear that this provision actually exists in the subject arbitration agreements.&nbsp; This language appears to have been cut and pasted from an argument pertaining to an entirely different agreement.&nbsp; In any case, the Order Agreement here provides that disputes will be resolved, “by a single arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.”&nbsp; [Kim Decl., Ex. 1, p. 3 of 5]. There is no choice provided to the party electing arbitration.</span></div><div><br></div><div>The Retail Installment Sale Contract provides, in pertinent part, “You or we may choose the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or National Arbitration and Mediation (www.namadr.com) as the arbitration organization to conduct the arbitration. If you and we agree, you or we may choose a different arbitration organization.”&nbsp; [Kim Decl., Ex. 2, p. 5 of 6].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The argument is evidently that the agreements allow for a choice of arbitration forum, but only for the party electing to arbitrate.&nbsp; &nbsp;The agreements do not mention the party electing arbitration, and in one document offers no alternatives.&nbsp; The Retail Installment Sale Contract imposes this selection on both the defendant and the plaintiffs in this matter (“you or we may choose”), regardless of who elects to arbitrate, and the parties agreed to this choice.&nbsp; The selection does not appear to give rise to any substantive unconscionability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also argue that substantive unconscionability can be found&nbsp; because of the arbitration cost provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These provisions are not set forth in the opposition papers, making it difficult to follow this argument, and arguably failing to meet plaintiffs’ burden to establish the elements of unconscionability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, the Order Agreement provides:</div><div>“To initiate the arbitration, you will pay the filing fee directly to AAA and we will pay all subsequent AAA fees for the arbitration, except you are responsible for your own attorney, expert, and other witness fees and costs unless otherwise provided by law. If you prevail on any claim, we will reimburse you your filing fee.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Kim Decl., Ex. 1, p. 3].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Retail Installment Sale Agreement includes a provision which states:&nbsp;</div><div>“We will pay the filing, administration, service, or case management fee and the arbitrator or hearing fee up to a maximum of $5,000, unless the law or the rules of the chosen arbitration organization require us to pay more. You and we will pay the filing, administration, service, or case management fee and the arbitrator or hearing fee over $5,000 in accordance with the rules and procedures of the chosen arbitration organization.”</div><div>[Kim Decl., Ex. 2, p. 5]&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, defendant argues that the pertinent provisions concerning the payment of fees do not render the agreements substantively unconscionable under the circumstances here.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both sides rely on Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC (2015) 61 Cal. 4th 899, in which the California Supreme Court found that the court of appeal had erred in finding an arbitration agreement in connection with a sales contract for an automobile unenforceable as unconscionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Sanchez, the Court found that the sales contract had been conceded by defendant dealership to have been adhesive in nature, which the Court found was “sufficient to establish some degree of procedural unconscionability.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Sanchez, at 915.&nbsp; However, the dealership in that case did not dispute that the contract was adhesive and did not contend that the consumer “could have opted out of the arbitration agreement or that he could have negotiated a sales contract without an arbitration agreement.”&nbsp; Sanchez, at 914.&nbsp; These facts are in contrast to this case, where there is no dealership conceding the contract was adhesive, and the arbitration agreement included an express opt out provision.&nbsp; &nbsp;This circumstance reinforces the absence of a sufficient showing of any procedural unconscionability here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to substantive unconscionability, the Court addressed an argument that the arbitration provision was substantively unconscionable because it provided that the dealership would advance the car buyer’s filing, administrative, service and other fees “up to a maximum of $2,500, which may be reimbursed,” at the arbitrator’s discretion.&nbsp; The provision also provided that in case of an appeal, the appealing party would be responsible for fees and costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrating panel of a fair apportionment of costs.&nbsp; Sanchez, at 918.&nbsp; The Court noted that the court of appeal had contrasted this arbitral scheme with the American Arbitration Association rules, which do not require consumers to front arbitration fees, and concluded that the requirement that an appealing party pay the filing fee and arbitration costs of both parties in advance put an unduly harsh burden on the buyer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sanchez, at 918.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court reviewed this conclusion in light of decisions arising in the context of mandatory employment arbitration of unwaivable statutory rights, and the special concerns accompanying employment contracts, and contrasted it with the law applicable in the context of consumer arbitration agreements, particularly those involving consumers seeking a new vehicle.&nbsp; The Court noted that in this context, legislation had been enacted to address fees and costs in consumer arbitration, which provided for waiver of fees for indigent consumers, requiring such consumers to establish eligibility for a waiver under the statutory provisions.&nbsp; The Court of appeal concluded:</div><div>“But given the Legislature's approach to the affordability of consumer arbitration, the provision cannot be held unconscionable absent a showing that appellate fees and costs in fact would be unaffordable or would have a substantial deterrent effect in Sanchez's case. (See Gutierrez, supra, 114 Cal.App.4th at pp. 90–91).”</div><div>Sanchez, at 921.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court, in applying the rule to the case before it, concluded:</div><div>“The dispute in this case concerns a high-end luxury item. Sanchez does not claim, and no evidence in the record suggests, that the cost of appellate arbitration filing fees were unaffordable for him, such that it would thwart his ability to take an appeal in the limited circumstances where such appeal is available. We therefore conclude on the record before us that the arbitral appeal fee provision is not unconscionable.”</div><div>Sanchez, at 921.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, first, it appears that the Order Agreement defaults to the fee and costs provisions of the American Arbitration Association, which the Court in Sanchez had noted were proper.&nbsp; In any case, as discussed above, this provision is expressly subject to an opt out option, which plaintiffs chose not to exercise.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, even if the Retail Installment Sale Agreement provision were to be applied, limiting the fees and costs to $5,000, and not directly addressing costs on appeal, this case is very similar to Sanchez, as the vehicle in question is a high-end luxury item.&nbsp; Defendant argues that the Sanchez case involved a used Mercedes-Benz purchased for approximately $53,498.60, in 2008.&nbsp; Sanchez, at 907.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argues that this is less than the sale price of plaintiffs’ new Tesla vehicle here, which the Retail Installment Sale Contract reflects was purchased for a total sale price of $87,145.24.&nbsp; [Ex. 2, p. 1].&nbsp; It does appear that this case similarly involves a transaction involving a “high-end luxury item,” and, as in Sanchez, plaintiffs in this case have also failed to submit any evidence which would suggest that the cost of arbitration fees and costs would be unaffordable to plaintiffs.&nbsp; Sanchez, at 921.&nbsp; In the absence of such evidence, the provision cannot be found unconscionable.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">		</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>In sum, there has been no sufficient evidence submitted to establish that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable here, and the motion is not denied on this ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Plaintiffs, in fact, appear to anticipate that the motion will be granted, but argue that if the court finds that plaintiffs must arbitrate their claims, then plaintiffs elect to arbitrate at JAMS rather than AAA.
