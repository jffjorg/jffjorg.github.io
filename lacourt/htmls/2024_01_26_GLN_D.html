&nbsp;Ivy Fung was the Trustee, with successor Trustees being plaintiff and/or Marie Bernardini.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Trust was created by Ivy Fung after she was diagnosed with terminal illness, and was revocable until her death, after which the Trust became irrevocable and all Trust property was to be handed over to her only child and next of kin, plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ivy Fung transferred her real property in La Crescenta to the Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that Marie Bernardini had been named as a successor trustee by connections between Ivy Fung, Bernardini, defendant Chaba Monari and defendant Church of Scientology.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that trust funds were used to pay defendant Monari over $200,000 a year from 2016-2017, and that following the death of Ivy Fung, Marie Bernardini began encumbering the property with loans facilitated by other defendants, used trust funds and loans to pay off her personal obligations, transferred funds to her company defendant Realty Home Solutions, and that following Marie Bernardini’s death, Bernardini’s husband defendant Jim Cox sold the property to a bona fide purchaser.&nbsp; The trust was depleted of all funds with the exception of $3,000.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint also alleges that defendant Cox removed personal property of Ivy Fung from the property, including expensive jewelry.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, conversion, and negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on October 6, 2022, the court heard an OSC re: Default Judgment/Default Prove Up, at which the court was informed that defendant Jim Cox Sr. was deceased, with decedent’s son, James Cox Jr. being present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the OSC discharged and stayed the case “in its entirety, pending the disposition of the probate case.”</div><div><br></div><div>On September 11, 2023, the court conducted a Status Conference Re: Stay/Probate Case/Status of Successor in Interest, at which Travis Cox, son of decedent, was present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the stay previously ordered to remain in full force and effect pending a hearing on this motion to substitute Travis Cox as a party defendant in this action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This motion was originally heard on December 8, 2023.&nbsp; The motion was continued to this date, January 26, 2024, for the submission of supplemental evidentiary proof concerning compliance with the requirements of the Probate Code, with the stay of this matter to remain in effect pending the continued hearing on the matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff has filed a timely supplemental declaration in support of the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff brings this motion seeking an order substituting Travis Cox as party defendant in this action in place of defendant Jim Cox, deceased, in the capacity of Travis Cox as the personal representative of the Estate of Jim Cox.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 377.20 (a) provides that “a cause of action for or against a person is not lost by reason of the person’s death but survives subject to the applicable statute of limitations period.”&nbsp; CCP § 377.21 provides “A pending action or proceeding does not abate by the death of a party if the cause of action survives.”&nbsp; There is no challenge here that the causes of action do not survive.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 377.40 provides that:</div><div>“Subject to part 4 (commencing with section 9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims, a cause of action against a decedent that survives may be asserted against the decedent’s personal representative...”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 377.41 provides that:</div><div>“On motion, the court shall allow a pending action or proceeding against the decedent that does not abate to be continued against the decedent’s personal representative...except that the court may not permit an action or proceeding to be continued against the personal representative unless proof of compliance with Part 4 (commencing with Section 9000) of Division 7 of the Probate Code governing creditor claims is first made.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Probate Code section 9351 provides:</div><div>“An action may not be commenced against a decedent’s personal representative on a cause of action against the decedent unless a claim is first filed as provided in this part and the claim is rejected in whole or in part.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on Probate Code Section 9370, which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“(a) An action or proceeding pending against the decedent at the time of death may not be continued against the decedent's personal representative unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div><div>(1) A claim is first filed as provided in this part.</div><div>(2) The claim is rejected in whole or in part.</div><div>(3) Within three months after the notice of rejection is given, the plaintiff applies to the court in which the action or proceeding is pending for an order to substitute the personal representative in the action or proceeding. This paragraph applies only if the notice of rejection contains a statement that the plaintiff has three months within which to apply for an order for substitution.</div><div>(b) No recovery shall be allowed in the action against property in the decedent's estate unless proof is made of compliance with this section.</div><div><br></div><div>The supplemental declaration here shows that on January 23, 2023, an attorney for Bradley Tyer filed a Petition for Letters of Administration and Authorization to Administer Under the Independent Administration of Estates Act, requesting that Bradley Tyer be appointed administrator of the Estate of James Gilbert Cox III.&nbsp; [Supp. Shapiro Decl., para. 3, Ex. 1].&nbsp; The petition indicates that petitioner, a creditor, has contacted the issue of the decedent and requested each of them to open a probate to satisfy a judgment owed by the decedent, and that since all heirs expressed that they did not intend to open probate, petitioner was requesting appointment as administrator of the Estate.&nbsp; [Ex. 1, Attach. 3g(2)(a)].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The supplemental declaration also now attaches a Creditor’s Claim filed in the case number assigned to the Petition on January 24, 2024, by claimant Bradley Tyer, who indicates claimant is the attorney representing a judgment creditor and has legal power of attorney, and sets forth as facts supporting the creditor’s claim that there is a case pending in the Glendale courthouse, that the Glendale court has ordered the civil case stayed pending disposition of the probate case, and which attaches minute orders from this Glendale action.&nbsp; [Supp. Shapiro Decl. para. 4, Ex. 2].&nbsp; The claim states the total amount of the claim is $1,200,000.00.&nbsp; [Ex. 2, para. 1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The supplemental declaration also states that the Creditor’s Claim has not been granted or denied as of the date of the submission of the declaration, and that “[a]s of this date, no allowance or rejection of the Creditor’s Claim has been made.” [Supp. Shapiro Decl., paras. 5, 9].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion previously had argued that since no rejection or allowance of the creditor’s claim has been made to date, under Probate Code section 9256, a creditor may deem a claim rejected 30 days after it is filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Probate Code section 9256 provides:</div><div>“If within 30 days after a claim is filed the personal representative or the court or judge has refused or neglected to act on the claim, the refusal or neglect may, at the option of the creditor, be deemed equivalent to giving a notice of rejection on the 30th day.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court previously had been concerned that the showing was incomplete, as there had been no evidence confirming that plaintiff filed a creditor’s claim, or when it was filed.&nbsp; That evidence has now been submitted, and a copy of the claim submitted, as discussed above.&nbsp; Although the claim does not identify plaintiff Ando as the creditor upon whose behalf claimant/attorney Tyer is making the claim, there is reference to the Civil Case of “Kurt Takashi Ando v. Jim Cox.”&nbsp; [Ex. 2, p. 2].&nbsp; The claim appears to satisfy the requirement under Probate Code section 9370, as set forth above, that plaintiff provide “proof” of compliance with the section, including proof that “(1) A claim is first filed,” by plaintiff in accordance with the section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court also had been concerned that the moving papers did not include&nbsp; evidence supporting plaintiff’s argument that that there was no notice of rejection served, when under subdivision (a)(2), plaintiff must provide proof that the claim has been “rejected in whole or in part.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court was also previously concerned that without proof of a notice of rejection, or lack thereof, the court could not confirm that subdivision (a)(3) would not&nbsp; apply here, requiring plaintiff to have applied to the court for an order to substitute the personal representative, “within three months after the notice of rejection is given,” if the notice contains a statement with this requirement.&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically, this motion was filed on August 30, 2023, and without details concerning the disposition of the claim, it could not be confirmed that the motion was timely.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The evidence submitted now includes a direct representation by counsel that there has been no action on the claim.&nbsp; [Supp. Shapiro Decl., paras. 5, 9].&nbsp; It appears that under Probate Code section 9256, “the court or judge has… neglected to act on the claim,” and that the neglect may be deemed equivalent to giving notice of rejection on the 30th day.&nbsp; &nbsp;The technical rejection of the claim here made on January 24, 2023, which would be deemed a notice of rejection as of February 23, 3023, appears to have accordingly been a rejection with did not contain a statement that plaintiff has three months within which to apply for an order for substitution.&nbsp; This motion, filed on August 20, 2023 would be timely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As previously noted, the declaration in support of the motion provides evidence concerning the appointment of the personal representative, stating,&nbsp;</div><div>“On August 15, 2023, the Probate Court appointed Travis Ethan Cox as Personal Representative of the Estate. A true and correct copy of the Minute Order from Probate Case 23STPB00726 is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.”</div><div>[Shapiro Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff’s counsel submits a copy of a minute order in the Probate Action, 23 STPB00726, In re: Cox, James Gilbert, III- Decedent, dated August 15, 2023 in which Travis Ethan Cox was appointed personal representative of the estate:</div><div>“The Petition - Probate of Lost Will (Subsequent) filed on 6/1/2023 by Travis Ethan Cox is granted.

&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the negligent acts or omissions of employees of defendants within the scope of their employment, plaintiff’s daughter, Liana Asatryan, died.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The FAC alleges that defendants caused to exist a dangerous condition of public property, including the playground at Balboa Elementary School, which was equipped with improper matting, which dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of causing fatal injuries, including those suffered by decedent.&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that the dangerous condition was created by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of defendants’ employees and/or that defendants had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition a sufficient time prior to December 2, 2021 to have taken measures to protect against it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Moving defendant Glendale Unified School District filed a demurrer in response to the original complaint, which was heard on June 23, 2023.&nbsp; The court issued a tentative ruling via posting on LACourt.org website, which was to overrule the demurrer to the second cause of action for dangerous condition of public property, and to sustain the demurrer with leave to amend to the first cause of action for negligent act or omission of public entity or public employee.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The matter was called for hearing, the court indicated it had read and considered the moving papers, arguments of counsel, and the law, and counsel submitted on the court’s tentative ruling.&nbsp; The court adopted its tentative ruling as the final order of the court.&nbsp; The minute order was corrected nunc pro tunc later that date with the modification to allow plaintiff 20 days to amend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On August 15, 2023, defendant Glendale Unified School District filed a demurer to the First Amended Complaint, arguing that the second cause of action for dangerous condition of public property failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.&nbsp; The demurrer made no mention of the first cause of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;The demurrer was set to be heard on November 3, 2023, and was opposed by plaintiffs, with plaintiffs pointing out that the demurrer was improper as the court had previously overruled a previous demurrer to the second cause of action in the original complaint.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant nevertheless permitted the previous demurrer to the FAC to remain on calendar until 3 pm on the afternoon November 2, 2023, the afternoon before the hearing, after plaintiff had been forced to file written opposition and the court had prepared a tentative ruling.&nbsp; &nbsp;On November 2, 2023, defendant filed a Notice of Taking Demurrer to First Amended Complaint Off Calendar, indicating that defendant Glendale Unified School District was taking the pending demurrer to plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint “OFF CALENDAR.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Eleven minutes later, on November 2, 2023, defendant filed its Amended Notice of Demurrer and Demurrer to First Amended Complaint, to be heard on this date, January 26, 2024.&nbsp; The amended demurrer does not mention the second cause of action of the FAC, but is solely directed to the first cause of action of the FAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On November 3, 2023, at the hearing on the demurrer to the FAC, the matter was called for hearing, and the court’s minute order noted, “Moving party has withdrawn their Hearing on Demurrer—Without Motion to Strike.”&nbsp; The court conducted a Case Management Conference.&nbsp; There is no mention of any pending “amended” demurrer in the court’s minute order.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural&nbsp;</div><div>Untimely</div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the demurrer should be overruled as untimely.&nbsp; The court notes that this is the second time defendant Glendale Unified School District has filed an untimely demurrer in this action, the demurrer to the original complaint being filed over five weeks late.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP §430.40, the time permitted to demur to a complaint is “within 30 days after service of the complaint…”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP §471.5 (a), with respect to an amended complaint, this thirty-day deadline is also clear and specific:</div><div>“(a) If the complaint is amended, a copy of the amendments shall be filed, or the court may, in its discretion, require the complaint as amended to be filed, and a copy of the amendments or amended complaint must be served upon the defendants affected thereby. The defendant shall answer the amendments, or the complaint as amended, within 30 days after service thereof, or such other time as the court may direct…”</div><div>(Emphasis added).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the FAC was filed and served by electronic service on July 13, 2023.&nbsp; Thirty days from that date, plus an additional two days for service by electronic service, was August 14, 2023.&nbsp; The demurrer was filed and served on November 2, 2023, over eleven weeks, nearly three months, late.&nbsp; There is no statutory provision or court rule permitting an extension of time without advance permission of the court.&nbsp; The demurrer is overruled as extremely untimely.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No Leave to Amend Obtained&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant characterizes the current motion as an “Amended” pleading, without pointing to any authority under which a party is permitted to amend a demurrer without advance leave of court, particularly after the time to demur has expired, and the previous demurrer to the same pleading has been opposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There is no indication in the file that defendant sought or obtained leave to file an amended demurrer.&nbsp; With respect to amendment of pleadings, CCP § 473 (a)(1) provides that “The court may..., in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading...”&nbsp; There has been no notice to the adverse party seeking permission to file an amended demurrer, and it is not clear that justice would warrant such permission in these circumstances.&nbsp; Any “terms as may be just” in this matter could include the possibility of plaintiffs requesting reimbursement for their wasted expense in opposing the original demurrer.&nbsp; The demurrer is denied as presenting an unauthorized amended pleading without defendant seeking by noticed motion to obtain advance leave of court.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Moreover, as argued in the opposition and evident from the file, there was at the time the “amended” demurrer was filed no operative demurrer in this action, as prior to the filing of the “amended” demurrer, defendant had voluntarily filed a formal Notice of Taking Demurrer to First Amended Complaint off calendar.&nbsp; [See Notice, 11/02/2023].&nbsp; The court on November 3, 2023 accordingly noted that the demurrer had been withdrawn by the moving party.&nbsp; There was no pleading left to amend, and no timely pleading pending before the court at the time of the filing of the amended pleading, and the amended pleading is also improper on this ground.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>No Meet and Confer&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs in opposition also argue that the amended demurrer is improperly brought by defendant without first having met and conferred.&nbsp; The amended demurrer indicates that defendant is in compliance with meet and confer requirements, as there has been a meet and confer concerning “this demurrer.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration in support of the motion states, “On August 3, 2023, at 3:15 pm, Defense counsel sent an email to plaintiff counsel, intended as a meet and confer as to the basis for this demurrer.”&nbsp; [Doumanian Decl., para. 3].&nbsp; No copy of the subject email is attached to the moving papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It is clear that the referenced meet and confer took place before the original demurrer to the FAC was filed on August 15, 2023, which demurrer was directed only to the second cause of action.&nbsp; The declaration does not include any other dates for meet and confer efforts which would be directed to this demurrer, which challenges only the first cause of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition indicates that the meet and confer email relied upon did not address this amended demurrer, but only raised issues concerning the second cause of action, the subject of the original demurrer to the FAC.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, that email is referenced in the moving declaration to support compliance with the meet and confer requirements, but the email is not attached to the moving papers.&nbsp; The opposition submits a copy of the subject email, which states, in pertinent part:</span></div><div>“I have looked at the amended complaint, and while you allege improper matting you don't allege that the child fell off of any playground equipment so that the matting allegations would be sufficient to withstand demurrer. I would like to avoid filing a demurrer but will have to as to the second cause of action. Let me know if you will dismiss that cause of action.”</div><div>[Akaragian Decl., para. 3, Ex. 1].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>No mention is made of the first cause of action, the exclusive subject of the amended demurrer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition argues that this email sought to discuss only the second cause of action of the FAC, and that at no time after that did defendant ever take issue with or attempt to meet and confer about the sufficiency of the factual allegations in the first cause of action.&nbsp; Plaintiffs point out that consistent with defendant’s meet and confer of August 3, 2023, defendant filed its previous demurrer to the FAC to only the second cause of action on August 15, 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs argue that defendant has not filed a declaration with this demurrer stating that a meet and confer as to the first cause of action has taken place nor set forth what the results of that meet and confer, which did not occur, were.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 430.41 requires that before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer:</div><div>“(a) Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. If an amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(1) As part of the meet and confer process, the demurring party shall identify all of the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with legal support the basis of the deficiencies. The party who filed the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer shall provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal insufficiency.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Moreover, the court in its minute order concerning the demurrer to the original complaint expressly ordered, “The parties are ordered to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP § 430.41 before any further demurrer may be filed.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 06/23/2023, p. 19].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears under the circumstances that defendant did not appropriately meet and confer concerning this particular amended demurrer prior to filing it.&nbsp; The court recognizes that it cannot overrule the demurrer on this additional ground under CCP § 430.41(a) (4), but the court would ordinarily consider continuing the hearing on the motion and requiring the parties to meet and confer, and requiring defendant to submit a supplemental declaration reporting the results of those meet and confer efforts prior hearing the matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, given the current posture of this motion, this will be unnecessary.&nbsp; Defendant is reminded that in this litigation, defendant must fully comply with all meet and confer obligations and requirements before the court will consider any future matter with meet and confer requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Substantive&nbsp;</div><div>First Cause of Action—Negligent Act or Omission of Public Entity or Public Employee&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Considering the amended demurrer on its merits, the court properly overrules the demurrer..&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, the amended demurrer is directed only to the first cause of action of the FAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The previous demurrer to this cause of action in the original complaint was sustained as follows:</span></div><div>“Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND to the first cause of action for Negligent Act or Omission of Public Entity or Employee on the ground the complaint does not in the allegations in the paragraphs supporting the cause of action itself do not reference a statutory basis for the cause of action, and on the ground the cause of action does not allege sufficient facts supporting each element of a statutory cause of action, including Government Code section 815.2.”</div><div>[Minute Order 06/23/2023, p. 19].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Glendale Unified School District argues that plaintiffs have not cured the defect in the cause of action, have still not pled sufficient facts to support a negligence cause of action, and that negligence actions are not proper as against public entities.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under Government Code § 815:</div><div>“Except as otherwise provided by statute:</div><div>(a) A public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of a the public entity or a public employee or any other person.”</div><div><br></div><div>This statute is recognized to have eliminated common law claims for negligence against a public entity; liability must be based on statute.&nbsp; See, e.g., Mikkelsen v. State of California (1976, 2nd Dist.) 59 Cal.App.3d 621, 626-628; Torres v. Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (2013, 2nd Dist.) 217 Cal.App.4th 844, 850 (“Although the complaint sounds in negligence, there is no common law tort liability for public entities in California.”)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is held that when pleading negligence against a public entity, even where the negligence is that of the public entity directly, plaintiff must allege and identify the statute establishing the duty owed by the public entity.&nbsp; Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist.&nbsp; (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court had previously been concerned that although the complaint in the caption of the complaint and the title of the First Cause of Action referred to the cause of action as “Negligent Act or Omission of Public Entity or Public Employee [Cal. Gov’t Code section 815.2],” the statute, Government Code section 815.2, had not been referenced in a formal allegation within a paragraph of the pleading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The FAC has now corrected this insufficiency by alleging that defendants are “liable under Government Code 815.2,” and further specifically identifying the statute in the first cause of action.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 20].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that plaintiffs have not identified any statutory basis altogether.&nbsp; Defendant does not indicate why the references in paragraph 20 are insufficient, but focuses on allegations it quotes from paragraph 16 of the FAC, which allegations do not in fact appear at that paragraph of the FAC.&nbsp; The quoted allegations do not appear in the original complaint, either.&nbsp; Defendant instead appears to be quoting allegations from another case altogether and goes on to argue that while plaintiff has pleaded a cause of action “against his assailant and the assailant’s parents under Civil Code section 1714,” plaintiff has not identified any statute that enables a civil cause of action against a public entity defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Motion, p. 8].&nbsp; This case does not involve allegations that decedent was harmed by an assailant, and defendant appears to have cut and pasted this language from a demurrer in another matter.&nbsp; In any case, the statutory basis for the first cause of action, which enables a civil cause of action against a public entity defendant, Government Code section 815.2, is now sufficiently alleged in the FAC and in the first cause of action itself.&nbsp; The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that there are insufficient facts to support the cause of action as the FAC does not contain any factual information about how the child died, how the child was hurt at school or any other information as to who, how, what, when, where, and why which are fundamental to the notice pleading requirements in California.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;It is held that statutory causes of action must be pled with factual particularity.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lopez v.

City of Redondo Beach (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 1, in which the Second District affirmed judgment for defendant City after its demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint was sustained without leave to amend, noting that factual specificity is required in pleading statutory causes of action against public entities:</div><div>“Because recovery is based on a statutory cause of action, the plaintiff must set forth facts in his complaint sufficiently detailed and specific to support an inference that each of the statutory elements of liability is satisfied.

Government Tort Liability (Cont.Ed.Bar 1980) § 3.72.)</div><div>Mittenhuber, at 5.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, the cause of action now alleges that it is based on Government Code section 815.2, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a)&nbsp; A public entity is liable for injury caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cause of action now alleges that on December 2, 2021, while decedent was a student and on the public property at Balboa Elementary School, defendant’s employees failed to</span></div><div>“properly supervise, care for, protect, rescue and provide and obtain prompt medical care, aid and attention, and/or provide the proper medical aid to Decedent while she was a student under the care, supervision, custody, and control of employees of Defendants …at Balboa Elementary School, and was visibly exhibiting symptoms indicating she had a serious medical condition, under circumstances giving rise to a cause of action against said employees.”</div><div>[FAC, para. 19].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is further alleged, by reference to the elements of a claim under Government Code section 815.2, that defendants:</span></div><div>“are thus liable under Government Code 815.2 for the death of the Decedent and all injuries proximately caused by the acts and omissions of employees of said Defendants within the scope of their employment, because the acts and omissions described above would give rise to a cause of action against such employees, apart from section 815.2, and also the employees are not immune from liability for such acts and omissions given their duties and responsibilities to render aid to a student within their control exhibiting visible symptoms of a serious medical condition.”</div><div>[FAC, para. 20].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This allegations sufficiently allege details supporting the statutory claim upon which the cause of action is based.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that plaintiffs do not allege what any teacher or school district employee did nor did not do vis a vis plaintiff’s child, do not identify any employees, and do not allege that any employee struck or otherwise physically harmed their child, or any actionable act or omission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that the child was harmed when employees responsible for student safety did not respond appropriately to visible symptoms of a serious medical condition, so it is not correct that no act or omission is alleged in the FAC. There is no authority cited for any argument that plaintiffs are required to plead that an employee struck or affirmatively harmed their child, when defendant itself acknowledges that an omission may for the basis of a claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is no authority cited under which details concerning the date or other facts concerning decedent’s death be alleged, when the facts concerning the harm caused by defendant’s employees, and their liability apart from Government Code section 815.2 is alleged.&nbsp; Defendant does not argue that there is no such separate liability.&nbsp; &nbsp;The opposition argues that it is held that under statutes including Government Code section 815.2, “‘a school district is vicariously liable for injuries caused by [the] negligence’ of school personnel ‘responsible for student supervision.’”&nbsp; Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932, quoting Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747.&nbsp; &nbsp;This vicarious liability is what is alleged in the FAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is no authority cited by defendant for the general argument that the pleading is insufficient because a specific employee is not identified, as the supervisory roles of the subject employees are alleged, and such details would not necessarily be known to plaintiffs until discovery is conducted.&nbsp; The cause of action is sufficiently stated.&nbsp; The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also seems to make an argument that defendant enjoys some immunity from liability, but this argument is based on Government Code section 815, quoted above, which recognizes that claims against public entities may be based on statute, and as discussed above, a statutory basis has now been identified and alleged in the first cause of action.&nbsp; No other immunity is argued.&nbsp; The demurrer accordingly is overruled in its entirety.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendant Glendale Unified School District’s Amended Demurrer to First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED, procedurally and on its merits.</div><div>Procedurally, the demurrer is untimely, and is fashioned an “Amended” Demurrer, when no leave to amend the original demurrer to the FAC has been sought or permitted by the Court, and defendant had taken the original demurrer to the FAC off calendar before the “Amended” demurrer was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Substantively, the first cause of action of the FAC now sufficiently alleges a cause of action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ten days to answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 22STCV25483&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  January 26, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>6<span style="white-space:pre">				</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>1/26/2024&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">		</span></div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>22 STCV25483 <span style="white-space:pre">			</span>Trial Date:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>None Set&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Torossian v.

Personal Storage, Inc. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 464, 477, in which the court of appeal found that a jury had not erred in permitting an award of emotional distress damages in favor of a plaintiff against a storage facility which had been found liable to plaintiff for negligence, violation of the California Self-Storage Facility Act, and conversion, in connection with the storage of household goods, including rare furniture, family keepsakes, heirlooms and personal belongings plaintiff had stored with defendant following a divorce, which were wrongly handled.&nbsp; The court of appeal specifically dealt with the cause of action for conversion, and the nature of the responsibility of the self-storage facility.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal observed:</div><div>“where a converter takes possession and disposes of household goods or family heirlooms on the basis of a reasonable but erroneous belief as to title, the converter may legitimately contend that he acted without knowledge as to rightful ownership. However, the converter cannot claim he was unaware of the potential emotional harm his interference would cause.&nbsp; In contrast, the negligent destroyer of personal property—the defendant who fails to properly secure the bulldozer or the warehouseman who leaves paint rags next to a gas burner—has considerably less direct knowledge of the emotional consequences of his conduct. (See Thing v. La Chusa (1989) 48 Cal.3d 644, 647 [257 Cal.Rptr. 865, 771 P.2d 814]; Cooper, supra, 153 Cal.App.3d at p. 1012.)

However, as noted above (see fn. 18, ante, at p. 1381), plaintiffs have apparently abandoned their earlier claims of intentional and negligent misrepresentations.

Superior Court, 54 Cal.2d 318, 324 [5 Cal.Rptr. 697, 353 P.2d 305], "no rule or authority is cited which authorizes refusal to answer an interrogatory simply on the ground that the answer is known to the party seeking the information." In Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 56 Cal.2d 355, 373, it was pointed out that litigants have been given the statutory right to resort to both depositions and interrogatories for the purpose of pretrial discovery.”</div><div>Coy, at 218.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that defendant has conceded that plaintiff will have to rely on expert testimony to prove any defect, which seems to be an argument that the objection that the interrogatories call for expert testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The interrogatories are straightforward, and, as noted above, under CCP section 2017.010, “discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party…”&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>CCP sec. 2030 .010(a) specifically permits the propounding of contention interrogatories:</div><div>“An interrogatory may relate to whether another party is making a certain contention, or to the facts, witnesses, and writings on which a contention is based.&nbsp; &nbsp;An interrogatory is not objectionable because an answer to it involves an opinion or a contention that relates to fact or the application of law to facts, or would be based on information obtained or legal theories developed in anticipation of litigation.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, while the parties appear to agree that plaintiff will rely on experts to prove any theories concerning product defect, this position does not dispose of plaintiff’s obligation to answer interrogatories concerning her contentions in this matter.&nbsp; Plaintiff has failed to justify any of the asserted objections.&nbsp; The motion is granted, and plaintiff is ordered to serve further complete responses to the subject interrogatories, without objections.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Special Interrogatory No. 18</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The interrogatory requests that plaintiff identify her username or associated email addresses for each of her Social Media Accounts and Websites, and lists examples such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The response again lists several boilerplate objections and also states that the interrogatory invades plaintiff’s right to privacy and third party’s right to privacy.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that it is only asking for usernames or associated email addresses for plaintiff’s social media accounts, that there is nothing inherently private about this information requested, that no passwords or other login information is requested, and that social media accounts could provide insight into plaintiff’s social life through pictures and opinions posted, and assist in evaluating plaintiff’s claimed damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that defendant is not requesting posts or information pertaining to a specific social media platform, but requesting account access information for all websites plaintiff has ever interacted with.&nbsp; This position seems to be an argument of overbreadth, but plaintiff does not explain why there would be some burden on plaintiff to answer such a question.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that defendant has failed to justify why social media information is relevant, arguing that defendant has sat dormant in this case for six years and now requests irrelevant information to purportedly evaluate the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff argues that defendant’s own discovery responses indicate that defendant has not conducted any surveillance of plaintiff, and if defendant needed insight into plaintiff’s social life, it should have done so, or requested information by now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This argument appears to concede that information concerning plaintiff’s social life is relevant in this matter and does not justify any objection made by plaintiff.&nbsp; As argued in the reply, there is no authority cited pursuant to which a party must request discovery within a particular timeframe which has not been met here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to privacy, generally, in evaluating a discovery order involving information protected by this privacy right, the trial court should apply the framework set forth in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, for evaluating invasion of privacy claims.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First, a claimant must possess a “legally protected privacy interest.” Hill, at 35.&nbsp; Second, the claimant must have a reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular circumstances, including the customs, practices, and physical settings surrounding particular activities.&nbsp; Hill, at 36-37.&nbsp; Third, the invasion of privacy must be serious in nature, scope, and actual or potential impact.&nbsp; Trivial invasions do not create a cause of action.&nbsp; Hill, at 37.&nbsp; If there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and the invasion of privacy is serious, then the court must balance the privacy interest at stake against other competing or countervailing interests.&nbsp; Hill, at 37-40.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant relies on Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 531, in which the California Supreme Court reiterated that the Hill analysis is to be applied in determining the scope of discovery of private information, and that the burden to establish a privacy interest remains initially with the party asserting such an interest:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;“The state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 1.) Protection of informational privacy is the provision's central concern. (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) In Hill, we established a framework for evaluating potential invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. (Id. at pp. 35–37, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.)

Plaintiff does not attempt to make this showing.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that defendant cannot invade financial privacy without limit here but does not propose any limits.&nbsp; Plaintiff indicates that plaintiff has asserted a willingness to produce additional responsive documents, but defendant’s counsel chose not to meet and confer on this issue, and instead filed this motion.&nbsp;
