(King Cobra) alleges that it is a licensed general contractor, and in 2019 entered into a written agreement with defendants Corazon S. Nieves, Trustee of the Corazon Revocable Trust Dated October 10, 2013, to act as the general contractor for a project located on 3080 Hollywell Place in Glendale, which property was owned by defendant.&nbsp; There were also approved change orders and extra work performed that improved the property.</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that it performed all of the conditions of the agreement, but defendant materially breached the terms of the agreement by failing to pay for the work performed and owes plaintiff no less than the sum of $288,000 plus interest and prompt payment penalties.&nbsp; The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of written contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, indebitatus assumpsit, account stated, foreclosure of mechanic’s lien and declaratory relief.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Nieves, individually, and as trustee, has filed a cross-complaint in the lead case against King Cobra and its principal, Haroutyan Keshishyan, as cross-defendants, alleging that the construction contract between the parties did not contain any provision for payment of construction supervision fees to cross-defendants, or payment of profits, and that there were no executed change orders. The cross-complaint alleges that to finance the construction, Corazon obtained a loan from U.S. Bank (US Bank) (the Construction Loan), disbursements from which were handled by Dixieline Builders Fund Control, Inc.&nbsp; (Dixieline).&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that as of the time of the filing of this action, US Bank and Dixieline have paid to King Cobra the total sum of $613,501.00 out of the original contact price, and there remains $39,499.00 in escrow on hold until the instant litigation is resolved.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainant alleges that during the construction, Keshishyan alerted Nieves that disbursements were being held up by Dixieline because Dixieline required additional or specific forms to be completed, which Keshishyan offered to complete to spare cross-complainant the trouble of reviewing and completing the forms.&nbsp; Cross-complainant alleges that cross-complainant would sign the forms completed by cross-defendants, and was not permitted to review the documents, and was assured that cross-complainant would have the opportunity to review the documents and make adjustments or corrections later in the process.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that unbeknownst to cross-complainant, the Dixieline Standard Cost Breakdown included a provision for “supervision” fees of $35,000 and “profit” of $60,000, which were not discussed or agreed upon by the parties.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges that over the course of the construction, Keshishyan began requesting that Nieves pay King Cobra directly for monies to fund the construction, separate and apart from the Construction Loan, representing that such would expedite completion, and that defendants would agree to an accounting for cross-defendants to reimburse any overpayment from reimbursement received from Dixieline.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that cross-complainant ultimately paid cross-defendants direct payments of $332,579.22, and that cross-defendants have been paid a total sum of $946,080.22 from the Construction Loan and direct payments.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that in April of 2020, after cross-complainant refused an offer to sell the property as is to a buyer located by cross-defendants to resolve cross-complainant’s growing liquidity problems, cross-complainant refused to make any further direct payments and demanded that cross-defendants complete construction and perform an accounting.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendants then abandoned construction and took with them personal property belonging to cross-complainant, including appliances and fixtures, with the approximate value of $25,000.&nbsp; Cross-defendant King Cobra then recorded a mechanic’s lien and sued cross-complainant in this lawsuit.&nbsp; The cross-complaint in the lead case alleges causes of action for breach of written contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, fraud, elder financial abuse, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief.</div><div><br></div><div>This case, originally Case Number 22 GDCV00004, was consolidated with the lead case on July 29, 2022, with all further matters to be handled in Case Number 20 GDCV000728.&nbsp; Because of the timing of the consolidation, some of the pertinent papers were filed in Case Number 22 GDCV00004, including the operative First Amended Complaint, and can be located there.&nbsp; &nbsp;The First Amended Complaint in the case is brought by Nieves as plaintiff, on behalf of herself and as attorney in fact for her brother, who allegedly co-owns the subject property.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendants U.S. Bank National Association (US Bank), and its servicers and agents, defendant Dixieline Builders Fund Control (Dixieline), and defendant Pro Build Company, LLC (ProBuild) were negligent in issuing payments to the construction company King Cobra in connection with the construction project at 3600 Hollywell Place in Glendale because work was not performed in a workmanlike fashion, and defendants failed to properly inspect and verify that the construction work was properly done.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On August 12, 2022, the court heard a demurrer and motion to strike in connection with the FAC brought by defendants US Bank and US Bancorp.&nbsp; &nbsp;The demurrer was overruled to the first cause of action for negligence, second cause of action for breach of contract, and fourth cause of action for breach of contract.&nbsp; The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend to the sixth cause of action for unfair business practices.&nbsp; The motion to strike allegations of pain and suffering and emotional distress and claims for attorney’s fees was granted without leave to amend at the concession of plaintiff in the opposition papers.&nbsp; Plaintiff was permitted ten days leave to amend the sixth cause of action only.&nbsp; No further amended complaint has been filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On August 29, 2022, plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal with prejudice of the “6th Cause of Action (Unfair Business Practices) only—as to all Defendants.”&nbsp;

This circumstance, along with the other evidence, supports a reasonable inference that ProBuild was involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Triable issues of material fact remain with respect to the involvement of ProBuild in this matter, and its contractual arrangement with Dixieline, and the motion as to each of the causes of action against ProBuild is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Dixieline Builders Fund Control, Inc.’s Motion&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Dixieline Builders Fund Control, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication:</div><div><br></div><div>Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motion for Summary Adjudication:</div><div>Issue No. 1:&nbsp;

Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot enforce the terms as a third-party beneficiary. Further, Dixieline contracted with a third-party inspector, Barry Simonetti dba RES/COM Inspections, Inc., not ProBuild, to conduct the inspections on the subject property.

plaintiff will be unable to establish each element of its breach of contract action, as the evidence relied upon in the moving papers supports a reasonable inference that it was not a third-party consultant which conducted the inspections, but that the inspections were conducted, as clearly represented on each inspection report submitted by defendant, by ProBuild as “Inspector,” with the form completed on a ProBuild logo document, with no designation of any other inspector or inspection company.&nbsp; [Osberg Decl., para. 10; Compendium of Exhibits, Ex. 2, Response to Request for Admissions, Exs. 3-33.]&nbsp; The evidence submitted with the moving papers does not explain why the forms include such a reference, and defendant’s showing includes evidence that the inspector was in fact ProBuild, and that it was the business practice of Dixieline to have written consulting contracts with those it retained to provide inspection services, such as ProBuild.&nbsp; [Osberg Decl., para. 9, Ex. 4].&nbsp; The initial showing does not demonstrate that plaintiff will be unable to establish the existence of a contract or breach of such a contract between Dixieline and ProBuild, so that the burden does not shift to plaintiff to raise triable issues of material fact.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Even if the burden had shifted, triable issues remain with respect to the relationship between Dixieline and ProBuild, and their contractual arrangement with respect to the subject inspections.&nbsp;

[UMF No. 9, and evidence cited, Hatem Decl., para. 7, Ex. 4].&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no declaration from a witness from ProBuild denying that the inspections were conducted by ProBuild, which was expressly designated as the “Inspector” on each report.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition relies on testimony concerning the inspection reports, the identification of ProBuild as the inspector, and its designation in the processing of the construction loan, as well as the inspection reports themselves, which reflect that each of the 31 inspection reports is on a form which includes a logo and letterhead reading, “PROBuild.” [Nieves Decl., para. 12; Response to UMF Nos. 6, 7, and evidence cited, Dixieline Compendium of Exhibits, Ex. 2, Response to Request for Admissions, Exs. 3-33.]&nbsp; &nbsp;On each Inspection Report, the report states, “Inspector:&nbsp;

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in January of 1988, plaintiff, defendant, and Mohammad Kamruzaman purchased the premises through a purchase agreement, which expressly allocated a one-third ownership interest to each of the three purchasers.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint alleges that the purchase agreement also provides that title will be placed in defendant Badruzzaman’s name, but this was based on an understanding that defendant’s credit was superior to that of the other two owners, and it was agreed that defendant’s name being placed on title made no impact on the division of the interest in the property.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff contributed a greater share toward the down payment, contributing $12,000, when Kamruzaman contributed $9,000 and defendant contributed $9,355, but plaintiff did not have any expectation as to an increased interest in the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that plaintiff has been current on his portion of the mortgage payments and continues to make timely payments toward the mortgage proportionate to his share in the property, but that defendant has failed to make mortgage payments, forcing the lender to send out a default notice.&nbsp; Upon receipt of the notice, plaintiff paid funds to the lender to refinance the loan and cure the default.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff notified defendant that he was leaving the country on December 5, 2022, and returning January 25, 2023.&nbsp; When plaintiff arrived back in the country, the locks had been changed, and plaintiff had been wrongfully evicted from the premises.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff sent defendant a letter about the wrongful eviction, but defendant has yet to respond.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that defendant has accepted plaintiff’s payments toward the mortgage payments as a one-third owner, but never intended to put plaintiff on title or to give plaintiff his share of the ownership of the premises.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint seeks to quiet title in plaintiff as a 33% owner of the property and seeks damages for the harm allegedly caused by defendant’s wrongful conduct.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Badruzzaman has filed a cross-complaint against plaintiff as cross-defendant, alleging that cross-complainant Badruzzaman is the only true owner of the property, and has paid all incurred mortgage payments, costs, insurance, and property taxes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cross-complaint alleges that cross-complainant rented the premises to cross-defendant, his brother, at the request of their mother, and that the monies for the down payment were loans from his brothers, which were paid off.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendant Mansur prepared a fraudulent agreement stating that the loaned money would entitle cross-defendant and the third brother to one third interest in the property, which was later notarized and attached to the complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cross-complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, cancellation of instrument and damages for alleged fraud and deceit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>CCP § 438 establishes the procedures for moving for judgment on the pleadings, and provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(c)(1) The motion provided for in this section may only be made on one of the following&nbsp;</div><div>grounds:...</div><div>(B) If the moving party is a defendant, that either of the following conditions exist:</div><div>(i) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint.</div><div>(ii) The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div><br></div><div>Subdivision (d) provides that “The grounds for the motion provided for in this section shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion may be granted with leave to file an amended complaint, or without leave to amend, in which case, judgment may be entered in favor of the moving defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;CCP § 438 (h).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that the causes of action alleged in the complaint are defective, as they are based on a contract for sale of real property, which was entered into in January 1988, twenty-five years ago, and expired a year later, in January of 1989.&nbsp; The argument makes little sense, as it is based on a date eleven years later, not one.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, defendant relies on Civil Code section 886.010 (a), which provides:</span></div><div>“As used in this chapter:</div><div>(a)<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>“Contract for sale of real property” means an agreement wherein one party agrees to convey title to real property to another party upon the satisfaction of specified conditions set forth in the contract and which requires conveyance of title within one year from the date of formation of the contract, whether designated in the agreement a “contract for sale of real property,” “land sale contract,” “deposit receipt,” “agreement for sale,” “agreement to convey,” or otherwise.”</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear how this section makes the alleged contract in this matter somehow invalid such that a cause of action has not been stated in the complaint.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As an initial matter, the alleged contract upon which this argument is based is not before the court.</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that the parties “purchased the Premises through a purchase agreement.&nbsp; [Exhibit A].”&nbsp; &nbsp;However, there is no Exhibit A attached to the version of the complaint which was filed with the court.&nbsp; The court accordingly cannot ascertain that the contract at issue was in fact a contract for the sale of real property under the definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, under CCP § 438 (d):&nbsp;</div><div>“The grounds for the motion provided for in this section shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The facts concerning the contract do not appear in the face of the pleading, and there has been no request for judicial notice filed.&nbsp; The motion could be denied on this ground alone, but the court elects not to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as argued in the opposition, this case is not an action alleging a claim for an unperformed contract for the sale of real property, wherein one party, upon satisfaction of conditions set forth in the contract, will convey title.&nbsp; The agreement is not with the seller for purchase of the property, but rather is based on the agreement between the three purchasers concerning the way interest in the property would be held.&nbsp; &nbsp;This situation appears in the nature of a partnership agreement to hold properties pursuant to a partnership interest.&nbsp; The agreement also is not alleged to have required “conveyance of title within one year from the date of formation of the contract,” so any argument that a statute of limitations has expired does not appear to apply.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no cause of action stated for breach of contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition attaches a copy of a “Real Estate Investment/Purchase Agreement,” which is apparently the document upon which the moving papers rely.&nbsp; Although this document, as noted above, is not included in the copy of the complaint filed with the court, and is not properly before the court on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, even if the court were to consider it, the document confirms that the agreement is not subject to the statute relied upon, as it is not an agreement to purchase particular property, but an agreement between the three brothers to invest in property, hold it, and pay the mortgage in accordance with their respective interests in the property.&nbsp; &nbsp;[See Opposition, Ex. A].&nbsp; The Agreement, as alleged in defendant’s own cross-complaint, was drafted and executed in 1998 after the purchase of the property had been completed in 1988.&nbsp; There is no provision calling for a conveyance of title within one year of the date of formation of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant seems to argue in the alternative that even if the contract had been recorded, which defendant argues it has not, then Civil Code section 886.020, 886.030 or 886.040 would apply.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Civil Code section 886.020 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“If the party to whom title to real property is to be conveyed pursuant to a recorded contract for the sale of real property fails to satisfy the specified conditions set forth in the contract and does not seek performance of the contract or restitution of amounts paid under the contract, the party shall, upon demand therefor made after the operative date of this chapter, execute a release of the contract, duly acknowledged for record, to the party who agreed to convey title.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Civil Code section 886.030 provides expiration dates for a recorded contract, which are, incidentally, not one year, but five years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Civil Code section 886.040 provides:</span></div><div>“Upon the expiration of record of a recorded contract for sale of real property pursuant to this chapter, the contract has no effect, and does not constitute an encumbrance or cloud, on the title to the real property as against a person other than a party to the contract.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the contract was not recorded, but even if it was recorded, it expired over twenty years ago, so has no effect and does not constitute an encumbrance on the property.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, there is nothing from the face of the pleading which suggests the contract was recorded, or from the document attached to the opposition.&nbsp; &nbsp;The statutory scheme also clearly does not apply to “a party to the subject contract,” when it is alleged, and the document shows, that defendant and plaintiff were in fact parties to the subject contract.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 5, 7, Opposition, Ex.

County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A premises liability cause of action is stated where the following elements are alleged: Defendant owned, leased, occupied or controlled the property; defendant was negligent in the use or maintenance of the property, plaintiff was harmed, and defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.&nbsp; CACI 1000.</div><div><br></div><div>Civil Code § 1714(a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Accordingly, it is recognized that every landowner has a duty to maintain property in his possession or control in a reasonably safe condition.&nbsp; Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 674 (disapproved on other grounds in Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 527, n.5).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The pleading here alleges that defendants were the “owners, lessors, sub-lessors, managing agents, landlords, renters, managers, operators, marketers, inspectors, maintainers and controllers” of the subject commercial property.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 5].&nbsp; It is also alleged that all defendants were acting as the agents, servants, and employees of the other defendants within the scope of their authority and with the consent of the other defendants.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 6].&nbsp; These are allegations sufficient to allege a duty on the part of the moving defendants on several theories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading also alleges that defendants breached that duty by allowing a dangerously dirty, slippery or wet floor to be installed or maintained at the property and knew, or should have known, in the exercise of reasonable care, that a dangerous and unsafe condition existed.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 9, 10, 15, 16].&nbsp; &nbsp;These allegations are sufficient to allege a breach of duty on the part of defendants.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The pleading alleges that as “a direct and proximate result,” of defendant’s negligence and carelessness, plaintiff was injured, and specifically alleges that plaintiff was walking into a patient’s room within the premises, slipped on the dangerous condition on the floor, fell violently to the floor, and sustained serious injuries.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 8, 11].&nbsp; Plaintiff’s harm and damages are described as including plaintiff being hurt in her “health, strength and activity,” suffering “severe shock and injuries to her person,” causing pain and suffering, plaintiff suffering “emotional distress” and “permanent” injuries and being required to “obtain medical services.”&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. 11, 12, 16].&nbsp; &nbsp;These allegations are sufficient to allege that the negligence and the condition of the premises directly caused plaintiff injury, harm, and cognizable damages.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, all elements have been sufficiently alleged.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants appear to argue that there is some heightened specificity required, as plaintiff has not alleged where in a large medical center the accident occurred or described specifically as to the moving defendants their role in the incident.&nbsp; There is no case law cited which requires heightened specificity to state a negligence or premises liability claim.&nbsp; As noted above, the complaint alleges that plaintiff was walking into a patient’s room, and the various roles defendants are alleged to have occupied with respect to negligence and premises liability.&nbsp; As noted in the opposition, this situation also appears to be a case where defendants would be in a better position to know the specifics, while plaintiff may well need to conduct discovery to confirm, for example, the room location where she fell, or the employment or agency roles played by the defendants in connection with the incident.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Defendants also argue that with respect to a dangerous condition theory, the condition must be shown to have existed for a certain length of time for liability to be imposed.&nbsp; Again, there is no authority cited under which this level of specificity is a pleading requirement outside a public entity context and there is no allegation that the moving defendants are public entities or agents of public entities.&nbsp; The liability is alleged here on the alternative valid theory that there was actual awareness of the condition on the part of defendants.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 9].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants also argue that the first and second causes of action are duplicative, as they both sound in negligence and seek duplicative awards for general damages.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, this matter is now at the pleading stage, and under the liberal rules of pleading, parties are permitted to plead duplicative, alternative, or even inconsistent causes of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 177, 180; Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593 (“a party may plead in the alternative and may make inconsistent allegations.”).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, the opposition relies on Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnydale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 890, under which it was observed that the duplicative standard referred to by defendants is not listed as a ground to sustain a demurrer under CCP § 430.10.&nbsp; Blickman, at 890.&nbsp; The court of appeal in Blickman noted that although the motion to strike statute previously authorized a court to strike “irrelevant and redundant” matter from a pleading, the statute no longer includes that language, and concluded, “This is not a ground on which a demurrer may be sustained.”&nbsp; Blickman, at 890, italics in original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer accordingly is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendants Alex Dela Cuadra and Sona Isayan’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint for Damages is OVERRULED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ten days to answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 23GDCV00934&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  March 8, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div><br></div><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>5<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Date:<span style="white-space:pre">		</span>3/8/2024<span style="white-space:pre">			</span></div><div>Case No: <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>23 GDCV00934<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Trial Date:&nbsp; February 10, 2025&nbsp;</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Fearnside v.

Jackson pursuant to financial transactions between the parties in connection with an American Express Credit Card.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The file shows on December 15, 2016, plaintiff filed a Request for Entry of Default as to defendant, which default was entered as requested the same date.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>On January 4, 2017, a Judgment by Default by the court was entered, based on plaintiff’s written declaration, entering judgment for plaintiff and against defendant in the total sum of $53,700.81.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff American Centurion Bank seeks a court order evidencing assignment of the judgment it has against defendant to American Express National Bank.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that plaintiff merged with and into American Express National Bank effective April 1, 2018, that the surviving entity after the merger is American Express National Bank, and that plaintiff intends to enforce the judgment under its true and current name of American Express National Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 673, which provides:</div><div>“(a) An assignee of a right represented by a judgment may become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court which entered the judgment an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) An acknowledgment of assignment of judgment shall contain all of the following:</div><div><br></div><div>(1) The title of the court where the judgment is entered and the cause and number of the action.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) The date of entry of the judgment and of any renewals of the judgment and where entered in the records of the court.</div><div><br></div><div>(3) The name and address of the judgment creditor and name and last known address of the judgment debtor.</div><div><br></div><div>(4) A statement describing the right represented by the judgment that is assigned to the assignee.</div><div><br></div><div>(5) The name and address of the assignee.</div><div><br></div><div>(c) The acknowledgment of assignment of judgment shall be:</div><div><br></div><div>(1) Made in the manner of an acknowledgment of a conveyance of real property.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Executed and acknowledged by the judgment creditor or by the prior assignee of record if there is one.</div><div><br></div><div>(d)(1) If an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment purports to be executed or acknowledged by an authorized agent of the judgment creditor or an authorized agent of a prior assignee of record, then documentation sufficient to evidence that authorization shall be filed together with the acknowledgment of assignment of judgment.</div><div><br></div><div>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an assignee of a right represented by a judgment may also become an assignee of record by filing with the clerk of the court that entered judgment a court order or other documentation that evidences assignment of judgment by operation of law.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no acknowledgment of assignment filed by the moving party, and certainly no document complying with the provisions of subdivisions (b) or (c).&nbsp; No document including the required information has been filed, and no document is submitted which is executed and acknowledged by the judgment creditor or any prior assignee of record.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff submits a declaration of counsel, who is not the judgment creditor, and cannot authenticate or testify to any current status or relationship of plaintiff, which does not include the required information, but states that American Express Centurion Bank merged with American Express National Bank as the surviving entity after merger, and purports to attach a public record document from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approving the merger.&nbsp; [Declaration of Plaintiff’s Counsel, Raluca Rohan, para. 2].&nbsp; &nbsp;This showing is not an appropriate acknowledgment of assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In addition, although the declaration references an attached Exhibit A in connection with the purported merger, there is no Exhibit A in any of the documents submitted with the motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;As noted above, such a document could not in any case be authenticated by an attorney for the judgment debtor with no facts which would indicate that the attorney has personal knowledge concerning the matters in which the judgment debtor is involved.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>To the extent the motion relies on CCP section 673, subdivision&nbsp; (d), the motion fails to submit an acknowledgment of assignment of judgment under subdivision (d)(1), as noted above.&nbsp; To the extent plaintiff intends to rely on subdivision (d)(2), that subdivision requires the filing of “a court order or other documentation that evidences assignment of judgment by operation of law.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no court order filed, and, again as noted above, there is no documentation other than a declaration of counsel unaccompanied by any supporting documents that could be construed to constitute evidence of an assignment of judgment “by operation of law.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff also does not submit any legal analysis or explanation of what such documentation would include, or explain how the referenced, unattached, document would in any case constitute evidence of an assignment of judgment by operation of law, or under what law.&nbsp; &nbsp;The relief cannot be granted on this showing.&nbsp; The motion is denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff moves in the alternative for the court to enter an order permitting plaintiff to amend its pleading to reflect its current name pursuant to CCP section 473.&nbsp; Plaintiff quotes from CCP § 473(a), which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, there is no pleading or proceeding outstanding as to the moving party, as judgment has been entered.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 576 provides:</div><div>“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.”</div><div><br></div><div>Here, relief is not sought “before or after commencement of trial,” or “during the course of the action,” but after judgment has been entered, and any time for appeal has long run.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, since judgment has been entered, the proper subdivision of CCP § 473 would be subdivision (d), which provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For purposes of CCP section 473(d), the term “clerical error” is defined as follows:</div><div>“The controlling principle is that although clerical error may freely be corrected post judgment, judicial error may be corrected only by normal procedures for attacking a judgment...</div><div><br></div><div>The test which distinguishes clerical error from possible judicial error is simply whether the challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently (which is clerical error) versus <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>advertently (which might be judicial error but is not clerical error). (7Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Judgment, at 68, p. 595.) Unless the challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently, it cannot be changed post judgment under the guise of correction of clerical error.”</div><div>Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Corp. v. Western Pacific Roofing Corp. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 110, 117-118.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District in Tokio Marine relied on cases in which the governing test was whether the judgment was entered as intended by the trial court.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there has been no clerical error in the court’s judgment; judgment was directed to be entered in favor of plaintiff as named as requested by plaintiff in its Request for Entry of Default, and the judgment submitted to the court by plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Relief is not available under this section.&nbsp; The motion is denied.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No Opposition]</div><div><br></div><div>Motion for Order Evidencing Assignment of Judgment by Operation of Law is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
