Defendants have sent a letter to counsel for plaintiffs disclaiming plaintiffs’ right to the drainage easement and accusing plaintiffs of trespass.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants the Murphys, as Trustees of the Murphy Family Trust,&nbsp; filed a cross-complaint, alleging that in June of 2004, the Murphys had received fee title to the Murphy property, having purchased it from their predecessor, and that they thereafter transferred legal title to themselves in their capacity as Trustees of The Murphy Family Trust.&nbsp; Defendants allege that the June 18, 2004 grant deed from the predecessor conveys the entire fee interest of the entirety of the real property, without any exception and without the real property being burdened in any way by any easement in favor of any property to the north.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cross-complainants allege that the tract map of the Murphy property shows only a utility easement across the east side of the property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;The cross-complaint alleges that from 1961 through May of 2016, Gordon Hawkins owned and occupied the real property directly to the north of and adjacent to the Murphy property, and that at the time cross-complainants acquired the property, there were several block walls constructed on the Murphy property, less than sixteen feet from the boundary line, which area was also planted with maturing trees, bushes and other vegetation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainants allege that beginning in about 2013 and continuing into about 2014, they began the process of planning and seeking approval of the City of Sierra Madre to relocate a portion of one of the block walls, include in the relocation new drainage systems, and construct a two-story pool house that would be about ten feet from the boundary line. The plans were reviewed with Hawkins, who did not voice any objection or concern about drainage or any drainage easement. After receiving Hawkins’ consent, cross-complainants submitted their plans to the City, and they applied for the necessary permits.&nbsp; After receiving approval and the necessary permits, cross-complainants undertook the work, which was completed in 2015, and received final approval from the City.&nbsp; At no time since the work was completed has there been any problem with the drainage of the surface water flowing naturally from the Hawkins’ property.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges that in 2016, cross-defendants Birgit Haas and Scott Haas entered the Hawkins property, observed the Murphy property, including the relocated block wall, drainage systems, pool house, and vegetation that were within 16 feet of the boundary line between the properties, and were provided with documents showing Hawkins and his deceased wife had received, as their personal right, an easement for drainage purposes only over the northern sixteen feet of the Murphy property.&nbsp; Cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendants had the right to inquire about the improvements on the Murphy property at that time, which they either exercised or knowingly waived, but that on May 25, 2016, after having observed, examined, and investigated, cross-defendants chose to go forward with their acquisition of the Hawkins’ property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint further alleges that beginning in October of 2019, cross-defendants intentionally entered the Murphy property, without permission, and intentionally cut down trees, bushes and vegetation on the property, and have done so on several occasions, including an occasion after cross-complainants had hired a surveyor to mark the property line, cross-complainants had installed a wooden fence in compliance with the applicable municipal code,&nbsp; and installed a “No Trespassing” sign, and informed everyone on the other side, including cross-defendants, that they had no right or permission to enter the real property.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that cross-complainants have been damaged by the loss of the trees, bushes and vegetation which have been removed, and also by the circumstance that the integrity of the slope and ability to handle normal surface water flows and water flows during rainy seasons has been put at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for trespass to real property and trespass to timber.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On July 15, 2022, the court heard motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication brought by plaintiffs and by the Murphy defendants.&nbsp; The motion for summary adjudication brought by the Murphy defendants was granted as to the fifth cause of action of the SAC for permanent injunction and damages—violation of CC&amp;Rs, and the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief re CC&amp;Rs, on the ground defendants had submitted undisputed evidence showing that the property now owned by plaintiffs was conveyed to their predecessors in interest, Gordon Hawkins and Jeanne Hawkins, prior to the effective date and date of recording of the CC&amp;Rs plaintiffs were attempting to enforce.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Two of the remaining causes of action of the SAC and the cross-action based on the SACC went to a court trial in October of 2022 and August of 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;In February of 2024, the court entered it final statement of decision and a correction to that final statement of decision.&nbsp; On April 24, 2024, at a Status Conference re Trial, plaintiffs made an oral motion to the court for dismissal without prejudice of the second cause of action for private nuisance, and for permanent injunction and damages—interference with easement, which had been reserved to be tried in a second phase of the trial.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On September 3, 2024, judgment was entered in the matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment as to the SAC was for defendants and against plaintiffs the Haas parties on the first cause of action for quiet title to express easement, the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief re easement, and the fifth and sixth causes of action based on the CC&amp;Rs (as determined on the motion for summary adjudication discussed above).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment as to the SACC was for cross-defendants the Haas parties and against cross-complainants the Murphys as trustees of the family trust on the first cause of action for trespass to real property and the second cause of action for trespass to timber.&nbsp; Judgment as to the SACC was for cross-complainants the Murphys as trustees and against cross-defendants the Haas parties on the third cause of action for declaratory relief and the fourth cause of action for quiet title.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment was declared that the express easement that was the subject of this case was extinguished by adverse possession, extinguishment of the servitude, and/or abandoned by plaintiffs’ predecessors in interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Judgment was also declared that title to the Murphy property is free and clear of the Easement for Drainage Purposes Only recorded on July 9, 1962, and no other person or entity claiming any right, estate, or interest in the property adverse to the Murphys’ interest has any interest in the property.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The judgment states, “Costs and attorney’s fees, if any, to the prevailing party to be determined by a post judgment memorandum of costs and motion for attorney’s fees.”&nbsp; [Judgment, p. 4:1-2].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On November 15, 2023, the court heard a motion brought by defendants Terri Murphy and Michael Murphy for an award of attorney’s fees against the Haas parties for the work performed in connection with defendant’s defense against the Haas parties’ claims and causes of action for enforcement of the CC&amp;Rs.&nbsp; &nbsp;The motion was granted.&nbsp; The court found that defendants the Murphys were the prevailing parties in the portion of this action which was brought to enforce the governing documents of a common interest development, and were entitled to reasonable fees to prevail on those claims.&nbsp; The court found that reasonable attorney’s fees were $53,940.00, which were awarded to the Murphy defendants against plaintiffs Birgit Haas and Scott Haas.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Murphy parties and the Haas parties have each filed a Memorandum of Costs, seeking recovery of costs incurred in this matter.&nbsp; Each set of parties has filed a motion to strike and/or tax the costs sought by the other parties.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Motion to Tax Costs—Murphy Motion as to Haas Memorandum of Costs</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Murphys seek to strike, or, in the alternative, tax the costs sought by plaintiffs/cross-defendants the Haas parties, arguing that neither of the Haas’s are a prevailing party in this case, so have no right to recover costs, and even if it is assumed they are prevailing parties, the costs they seek are not allowable or recoverable.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Murphys argue that the Haas parties are not prevailing parties in this case.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 1032 (a) (4) defines “prevailing party”:</div><div>“(4) ‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.&nbsp; If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the ‘prevailing party’ shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.”</div><div><br></div><div>In this situation, as summarized above, judgment as to the SAC was for defendants and against plaintiffs the Haas parties on the first cause of action for quiet title to express easement, the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief re easement, and the fifth and sixth causes of action based on the CC&amp;Rs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment as to the SACC was for cross-defendants the Haas parties and against cross-complainants the Murphys as trustees of the family trust on the first cause of action for trespass to real property and the second cause of action for trespass to timber.&nbsp; Judgment as to the SACC was for cross-complainants the Murphys as trustees and against cross-defendants the Haas parties on the third cause of action for declaratory relief and the fourth cause of action for quiet title.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Judgment was declared that the express easement that was the subject of this case was extinguished by adverse possession, extinguishment of the servitude, and/or abandoned by plaintiffs’ predecessors in interest.&nbsp; &nbsp;Judgment was also declared that title to the Murphy property is free and clear of the Easement for Drainage Purposes Only recorded on July 9, 1962, and no other person or entity claiming any right, estate, or interest in the property adverse to the Murphys’ interest has any interest in the property.&nbsp;

The section specifically provides that “Discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery may be obtained “of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2030.300 provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete….</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.</div><div>&nbsp;If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully respond to discovery.&nbsp;

To the extent that this interrogatory seeks the identifying information and/or contact information of the current or former students of Glendale High School, the GUSD specifically raises privacy objections on the grounds that such disclosure would violate the protections afforded under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, which mandates that educational institutions protect the confidentiality of education records. 20 U.S.C. § 1232g; Rim of the World Unified School Dist. v.

National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, for evaluating invasion of privacy claims.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First, a claimant must possess a “legally protected privacy interest.” Hill, at 35.&nbsp; Second, the claimant must have a reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular circumstances, including the customs, practices, and physical settings surrounding particular activities.&nbsp; Hill, at 36-37.&nbsp; Third, the invasion of privacy must be serious in nature, scope, and actual or potential impact.&nbsp; Trivial invasions do not create a cause of action.&nbsp; Hill, at 37.&nbsp; If there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and the invasion of privacy is serious, then the court must balance the privacy interest at stake against other competing or countervailing interests.&nbsp; Hill, at 37-40.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, the California Supreme Court, in connection with a putative class action by a store employee against an employer under PAGA for alleged wage and hour violations, found that the trial court had erred in denying a motion to compel the employer, Marshalls of California, LLC, to identify and provide contact information of each nonexempt California employee during a two year period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the privacy objection, the Court set forth the following analysis to be applied:</div><div>“The state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 1.) Protection of informational privacy is the provision's central concern. (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) In Hill, we established a framework for evaluating potential invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. (Id. at pp. 35–37, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing considerations. (Id. at pp. 37–40, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.).”</div><div>Williams, at 552.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;“The state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy. (Cal. Const., art.

National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, 7 Cal.4th 1, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633 did not overrule the compelling interest/compelling need test, but only concluded such an interest need not be shown in every case. This is correct so far as it goes. A threatened invasion of privacy can, to be sure, be extremely grave, and to the extent it is, to conclude in a given case that only a compelling countervailing interest and an absence of alternatives will suffice to justify the intrusion may be right. (See, e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren (1997) 16 Cal.4th 307, 340–342, 66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d 797.) But the flaw in the Court of Appeal's legal analysis, and in the cases it relied upon, is the de facto starting assumption that such an egregious invasion is involved in every request for discovery of private information. Courts must instead place the burden on the party asserting a privacy interest to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion, and against that showing must weigh the countervailing interests the opposing party identifies, as Hill requires. What suffices to justify an invasion will, as Marshalls recognizes, vary according to the context. Only obvious invasions of interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be supported by a compelling interest. (Hill, at p. 34, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) To the extent prior cases require a party seeking discovery of private information to always establish a compelling interest or compelling need, without regard to the other considerations articulated in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, 7 Cal.4th 1, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633, they are disapproved.”</div><div>Williams, at 557.&nbsp;</div><div>Here, defendant GUSD, the party asserting the privacy objection, does not make a clear argument under this standard, but seems to argue that the students identified, evidently Georgi M., Gagik Ter-Hovsepyan, and Sayad N., would have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, based on Education Code § 49076, which provides:</div><div>“(a) A school district shall not permit access to pupil records to a person without written parental consent or under judicial order except as set forth in this section and as permitted by Part 99 (commencing with Section 99.1) of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There is no evidentiary showing submitted with the opposition which would support the argument that the witnesses identified were in fact pupils, or that the information requested can only be provided by reference to those records.&nbsp; Ordinarily, a representative of the school district would verify in a declaration the fact supporting such an argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, in addition to Education Code section 49077, GUSD relies on 34 CFR 99.30 (a), part of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), under which:</span></div><div>“(a) The parent or eligible student shall provide a signed and dated written consent before an educational agency or institution discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except as provided in § 99.31.”</div><div>Under section 99.31 (a)(9)(i), an exception arises when “The disclosure is to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that the Department of Education considers the scope of “Personally Identifiable Information” to include:</span></div><div>“(a) The student's name;</div><div>(b) The name of the student's parent or other family members;</div><div>(c) The address of the student or student's family.”</div><div>34 CFR 99.3&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>GUSD argues that the federal act prohibits disclosure, in reliance on 20 USC section 1232g (b), which provides under subdivision (1):&nbsp; “No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records (or personally identifiable information contained therein… of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It is not clear how the argument applies to the contact information of the witness identified as Assistant Principal Hasmik Simonyan, who evidently is not a pupil, so that contact records would not be governed by the codes and regulations cited.&nbsp; A further response providing the contact information for this witness accordingly is ordered with respect to this identified witness.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>With respect to any of the identified witnesses, GUSD does not attempt to establish that the threatened intrusion is serious.&nbsp; It does not appear that the threatened intrusion would in fact be serious, given that the only information to be disclosed would be the last names of two of the three identified pupils, and the residential addresses of all three pupil or former pupil witnesses and the non-pupil witness, which is very narrow information.&nbsp; More importantly, as emphasized in the reply, this is a situation where the parties have entered into a stipulation and have in place an order protecting the disclosure of this information and limiting its use to this lawsuit.&nbsp; GUSD under the circumstances has failed to establish an intrusion into privacy which is serious in nature, scope, and actual or potential impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Even if this seriousness showing had been made, plaintiff has in response shown how the information serves an important countervailing interest of permitting plaintiff to discover directly relevant information in this matter concerning the perceptions of these identified percipient witnesses of what occurred during the subject incident.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In general, information such as the residential addresses of percipient witnesses is considered a permissible form of discovery.&nbsp; As noted by the Second District in Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242,&nbsp; “One glance at the form interrogatories approved by the Judicial Council, particularly the interrogatories in the 12.0 series, demonstrates how fundamentally routine the discovery of witness contact information is.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Puerto, at 1250.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is generally recognized that information such as residential addresses or telephone numbers are “routinely disclosed during discovery,” particularly in “routine civil litigation,” and where there is an absence of disclosure posing a potential safety risk or implicating privacy in a matter such as an arrest or booking record.&nbsp; &nbsp;Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 347, 365.&nbsp; This appears to be in the nature of routine civil litigation and the routine identification of percipient witnesses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This situation also appears to be a situation where the contact information cannot be obtained in any less intrusive way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court must then consider any protective measures or feasible alternatives suggested by the party seeking protection.&nbsp; Defendant here has indicated that even if a court order is warranted here, defendant will still be obligated to notify the parents of any minor pupils or the majority age pupil directly to inform them of the court order in order to comply with GUSD’s statutory obligations.&nbsp; GUSD cites to Education Code section 48077, which provides:</div><div>“(a) Information concerning a pupil shall be furnished in compliance with a court order or a lawfully issued subpoena. The school district shall make a reasonable effort to notify the pupil's parent or legal guardian and the pupil in advance of compliance with a lawfully issued subpoena and, in the case of compliance with a court order, if lawfully possible within the requirements of the order.</div><div><br></div><div>(b) Once a court order or lawfully issued subpoena is issued to obtain a pupil's contact information, the school district shall make a reasonable effort to enter into an agreement with the entity that obtained the court order or subpoena requiring that the pupil contact information be maintained in a confidential manner.</div><div><br></div><div>(c) Notwithstanding the content or existence of any agreement with a school district, a party that obtains pupil contact information pursuant to this section shall not use or disseminate that information for any purpose except as authorized by the court order or subpoena.”</div><div><br></div><div>(Emphasis added).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Similarly under 34 CFR 99.31(a)(9), where the “disclosure is to comply with a judicial order…”&nbsp; under subdivision (i):</div><div>“(ii)&nbsp; The educational agency or institution may disclose information under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section only if the agency or institution makes a reasonable effort to notify the parent or eligible student of the order or subpoena in advance of compliance, so that the parent or eligible student may seek protective action…”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A feasible alternative accordingly appears to be permitting a sufficient time for defendant to comply with the court’s order so that defendant has the opportunity to make a reasonable effort to notify the interested parties in advance of its compliance with the court order.&nbsp; As noted above, an agreement has already been made with plaintiff to maintain the subject information in a confidential manner.</div><div><br></div><div>It would appear that the balance here strongly favors the disclosure of the information necessary to identify and contact witnesses affirmatively identified with knowledge by GUSD, and that the protective order, giving of notice, and providing a sufficient time window for a further response to permit reasonable efforts of notice to be given, would be appropriate.

(Dental Alloys) and Ilya Gorbonos bring this motion for an order vacating the default and default judgment arguing that entry of the default and default judgment was the product of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that they did not know about the lawsuit, the default, or the default judgment until recently, as the action was served by substituted service at a post office box which defendants had, due to an unexpected upheaval with respect to defendants’ business and home situation, involving water intrusion and multiple physical moves, failed to check the post office box until recently.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Relief is sought under the discretionary provision of CCP § 473(b), which provides:</div><div>“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.&nbsp; &nbsp;Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”</div><div><br></div><div>The trial court’s granting or denial of relief under this provision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.&nbsp; &nbsp;State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is noted that appellate courts are traditionally “favorably disposed toward such action on the part of the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies on their merits.”&nbsp; Mercantile Collection Bureau v. Pinheiro (1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 606, 608, citing Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1947) 31 Cal.2d 523.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion was brought on November 14, 2024, to set aside a default entered on June 20, 2024 and a default judgment entered on July 9, 2024.&nbsp; This is within six months after the default and default judgment were taken, and based on the circumstances discussed below, appears to be a reasonable time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion is also accompanied by a copy of each of the two answers sought to be filed; one by each of the moving defendants.&nbsp; [See, Exs. A, B].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The question remains whether defendants sufficiently have established that this is a case where the judgment and default were entered against defendants due to inadvertence, mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, defendants submit the declaration of defendant Ilya Gorbonos, who indicates:</div><div>“3.&nbsp; Prior to the present suit being filed, I lived with my wife at 12045 Hoffman St. in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, 91604. Due to an issue with water intrusion, our home became uninhabitable. In the time leading up to, and including the dates of the alleged lawsuit service and defaults, my wife and I were forced to move five times as a result of additional unrelated water damage in separate rental residence. This occurred over a span of 18 months.</div><div>-Due to water damage that occurred in our home on March 15, 2023, we moved to Calabasas, California from April 27 to March 1, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div>- Due to new, unrelated water damage in Calabasas, we moved to a new, temporary rental in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, from March 1, 2024 to April 30, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div>- We moved back to Calabasas on May 1, 2024 to May 27, 2024. Further water damage occurred in the Calabasas rental on May 20, 2024.&nbsp;</div><div>- We returned to Studio City on May 27, 2024 though the property is still not suitable. We are now in a dispute with our homeowners association.&nbsp;</div><div>- We moved to a rental in Encino on September 1, 2024, and remain there today.</div><div>[Gorbonos Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The declaration also indicates:</span></div><div>5.&nbsp; ….At the alleged time of the substituted service, myself and the operations of DAU were moved to Calabasas, California. Because of the chaos and multiple moves from home to home, and the distance from Calabasas to Studio City, the PO Box where the suit was substitute served went unchecked. If service had been attempted at any of the other addresses on file with the Secretary of State, it would likely have been successful in alerting us to the lawsuit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>6. When the move back to Studio City was made, the large volume of mail from the PO Box was placed in boxes to review at our home. It was not until reviewing the mail in a box that the lawsuit was discovered. We promptly contacted the Plaintiff through our business attorney in an effort to work out some kind of compromise or deal, but the Plaintiff was unwilling to be reasonable. We then learned about additional documents and hearings after our attorney found them on the court's website.”</div><div>[Gorbonos Decl., paras. 5, 6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The declaration also indicates that the defendants then promptly retained an attorney “in order to remedy the defaults and default judgments, and to file our answers.”&nbsp; [Gorbonos Decl., para. 7].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The timeline is not entirely clear here, but it appears that at the time the lawsuit was filed, on March 19, 2024, defendants were living in Encino, and at the time substituted service was made, on May 6, 2024, as well as when follow up mailing confirming substituted service was made, on May 9, 2024, defendants were in Calabasas.&nbsp; By the time of the entry of default on June 20, 2024 and the entry of default judgment on July 9, 2024, defendants were in Studio City.&nbsp; It is not clearly stated when defendants checked the PO box and discovered the service of summons and complaint, but it must have been before the motion was filed on November 14, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>A party seeking relief under section 473 on the ground of excusable neglect bears the burden of demonstrating that the neglect was excusable in order to secure relief.&nbsp; See Cochran v. Linn (1984, 2nd Dist.) 159 Cal.App.3d 245, 252.&nbsp; The test of whether neglect was excusable is “whether a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances might have made the same error.”&nbsp; Bettencourt v. Los Rios Community College Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 270, 276, quotation, citation omitted; Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016, 2nd Dist.) 244 Cal.App.4th 918, 929 (“Within the context of section 473(b) neglect is excusable if a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances might have made the same error.”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Here, it does not necessarily appear reasonable that defendants, in attending to their corporate and personal business, did not check a post office box. The motion concedes that this post office box had been identified as a post office box where its agent for service of process could be served with process. This post office box had been in effect for many months, at least from when substituted service was made at the post office box on May 6, 2024 to some unspecified time before November 14, 2024.&nbsp; This time frame is a period of slightly over five months.&nbsp; Specifically, the declaration states, “The instant suit was served via substituted service at a PO Box in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. DAU is a corporation, and it has multiple addresses listed with the California Secretary of State. A true and correct copy of the Statement of Information on file with the California Secretary of State's office is attached and incorporated into this complaint as Exhibit "C".&nbsp; [Decl., para. 5].&nbsp; Exhibit C confirms the only address listed for the agent for service of process, Gorbonos, was “2400 VENTURA BLVD UNIT 1345 STUDIO CITY, CA 91604,” which is the post office box where service was made.&nbsp; [Ex. C, p. 1, “Agent for Service of Process;” Proof of Service, filed 05/10/2024, para. 4]&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no authority under which plaintiff was required to serve the agent for service of process at alternate addresses to effect service of process, and no alternate addresses appear on the Secretary of State document for the agent, as opposed to for the business or officers. Defendants appear to concede service was proper, but they depend upon the fact that the service did not result in actual notice to defendants due to the circumstances of defendants’ many moves and not checking the post office box in the meantime.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this does not appear to be a case where defendants had any other reason to have believed that there was a lawsuit proceeding against them, and this lapse in attending to the business, rather than to the known service of a complaint, might appear understandable under the circumstances involving disruption of residences by water intrusion. There is no indication that defendants in fact knew about this action, or are seeking relief after, for example, changing their minds concerning the advisability or intent of defending against the lawsuit.&nbsp; The default was sought on the very first date on which default could be entered in this action.&nbsp; [Spiwak Decl., paras.&nbsp; 7-9].&nbsp; The circumstances do not warrant overcoming the preference that this matter be determined on its merits.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that relief should not be permitted here where defendants were grossly careless in the monitoring of their post office box and their business affairs, which was not reasonable, particularly given that the post office box was located within the same county as each of the places defendant Gorbonos has lived over the past year.&nbsp; While this situation is not ideal, the court is not inclined find that gross carelessness is shown here. Rather, the conduct here could reasonably construed as excusable neglect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also argues that plaintiff will be prejudiced if the relief is granted, as plaintiff has now obtained the status of judgment creditor through the entry of the default judgment, and setting it aside would eliminate this status, and interfere with plaintiff’s ability to recover on a judgment against defendants as against potential other creditors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>This claim is not prejudice which would prevent plaintiff from pursuing its case on the merits, and obtaining a judgment on merits, if proper.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The court finds that the default and default judgment were entered due to excusable neglect. The court exercises its discretion to set aside the judgment and the default.&nbsp; This result is in keeping with the preference for permitting the adjudication of legal controversies on their merits.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the alternative requests that if the court is not inclined to deny the motion outright, the court impose conditions on the granting of relief from the default and default judgment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>As noted above, under CCP § 473(b), the court may grant relief “upon any terms as may be just…”</span></div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 473(c)(1): “Whenever the court grants relief from a default, default judgment, or dismissal based on any of the provisions of this section, the court may do any of the following:</div><div>(A) Impose a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending attorney or party.</div><div>(B) Direct that an offending attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund.</div><div>(C) Grant other relief as is appropriate.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In Jade K. v.

Until the matter is heard on its merits, however, it is not clear plaintiff is entitled to security as a judgment creditor.&nbsp; This relief is not granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that defendants should be ordered to compensate plaintiff in the sum of $6,691.50 for attorney’s fees and costs incurred in obtaining and attempting to collect the judgment.&nbsp;

Proc. § 1032(b), and that due to a CCP section 998 offer, it is cross-complainants’ “position” that judgment should be issued for post-offer expert witness fees, so that the “total value of Mr. Goodrich’s indemnification obligations pursuant to the Release would be at least $1,165,486.19.”&nbsp; [Memorandum, p. 7].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is no evidence at all submitted supporting this argument concerning the amount of damages to be awarded on summary adjudication, and such arguments are not set forth as facts with supporting evidence in the separate statement.&nbsp; [See Compendium of Evidence; Shimkin Decl.; Separate Statement].&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no documentation reflecting any sum of fees or costs incurred in connection with the claims allegedly subject to the express indemnity agreement, such as billing records, or invoices.&nbsp; The argument concedes the damages are not pursued in a specific amount, arguing that cross-defendant’s indemnification obligations would be “at least” an unsupported amount.&nbsp; [Memorandum, p. 7:12-13].&nbsp; The proposed order submitted with the moving papers leaves the amount to be paid to cross-complainants by cross-defendant blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cross-complainants accordingly have failed to sufficiently establish each element of the cause of action it seeks to summarily adjudicate entitling cross-complainants to judgment, as the issue of the full amount of damages to be awarded remains to be tried.&nbsp; As set forth above, under CCP § 437c(p)(1), to establish entitlement to summary adjudication, a cross-complainant, “has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.”</div><div><br></div><div>The motion is denied on the ground damages have not been sufficiently established by the moving parties, so an essential element of the cause of action which moving cross-complainants seek to summarily adjudicate has not been proved.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, the argument itself, even if it had been supported by evidence, appears to seek differing total sums, stating first that cross-complainants are owed $1,254,449.04 in fees and costs, and then later seeking “at least” $1,165,486.19.&nbsp; The argument itself gives rise to competing reasonable inferences concerning the amount of relief being sought, further emphasizing the insufficiency of the showing.&nbsp; CCP § 437c(c) provides that “summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or evidence that raise a triable issue as to any material fact.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This posture is not a situation where the motion seeks to establish, for example, entitlement to an immediate duty to defend, based on a separate cause of action for declaratory relief seeking such relief separately from damages.&nbsp; As set forth above, the second cause of action sought to be adjudicated in the cross-complaint clearly seeks damages.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; The trial court in Department of Industrial Relations apparently had ordered appellant in that case to move for summary judgment on the issue of liability, with damages to be determined in a later accounting procedure, which the court of appeal found improper under the summary judgment statute in effect at the time.
