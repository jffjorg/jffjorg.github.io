At the previously alleged time and place, Defendants, A &amp; D FIRE SPRINKLERS, INC. and NATIONAL COMMUNITY RENAISSANCE OF CALIFORNIA operated, maintained, controlled, owned, repaired, renovated, managed and/or conducted construction work on the property located at 1116 Sonora Ave., Glendale, CA 91205 which was the property directly behind the subject premises. At the previously alleged time and place, Defendants were conducting construction work installing new fire sprinkler systems at the property located at 1116 Sonora Ave., Glendale, CA 91205. As a result of Defendants and each of their negligence, a major water overflow from 1116 Sonora Ave. caused Plaintiffs entire unit to be flooded. Defendants' failure to exercise ordinary care while conducting construction work at, around or near the subject premises caused water to enter Plaintiffs unit causing Plaintiff to incur property damage including but not limited to her nerve conduction machines, office furniture, electronic devices, etc. Furthermore, following the first major waterflow into Plaintiffs unit, the subject premises was flooded on two other occasions one in February of 2019 and another in March of 2019 as a result of Defendant negligently, carelessly, and recklessly conducting proper construction work at the construction site allowing the water to flow into Plaintiff unit causing further property damage. As a result of the multiple water flows, Plaintiffs business become inoperable for 6 months which caused Plaintiff to not only lose business but to also lose income throughout the years. Defendant A &amp; D Fire Sprinklers failed to properly train, supervise, employ, manage and/or control its agents, employees and workers to properly conduct construction work on the premises in order to avoid any water from flowing outside the construction site and into the adjacent property as it did in the instant matter. Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiffs to take reasonable steps to adequately maintain, manage, control, operate, repair and conduct construction work on the property. Discovery is ongoing and Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement her response to this request upon new and admissible information.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The responses clearly do not comply with the court’s previous order to the extent they include the language that, “Discovery is ongoing, and Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement her responses to this request upon new and admissible information,” as the court expressly ordered that this was not an acceptable response.&nbsp; Further responses which do not include this language will be ordered to be served.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants argue that the responses do not provide facts in support of plaintiff’s claims, but provide a series of legal conclusions, include no new facts implicating either of the propounding defendants in the alleged claims, and simply switch around the order of the prior sentences responding to the interrogatories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The responses do consist primarily of repeating the allegations of the pleading, without the types of factual details which would be expected to be within plaintiff’s knowledge based on a reasonable investigation and inquiry at this point in the litigation.&nbsp; The responses are not directed specifically to the conduct being alleged to have been engaged in by propounding party by each plaintiff. Further responses which provide all facts which support the conclusory statement are ordered to be served, without any qualifying language, and if plaintiff has no further facts, plaintiff will be bound by that admission, and be prohibited from presenting any facts not disclosed in discovery at the time of trial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Special Interrogatory No. 19</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Special Interrogatory No. 19 asks:</span></div><div>“If YOU contend YOU suffered a loss of income, please IDENTIFY all DOCUMENTS that support YOUR loss of income claim.&nbsp; (As used in these interrogatories, the term ‘IDENTIFY,’ as to a DOCUMENT means to state the author, recipient, date and general description of the DOCUMENT.)”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court’s previous minute order also overruled all objections, including the same language set forth above in connection with Interrogatories Nos. 1 and 4, and also stated:</span></div><div>“Further response to Special Interrogatory No. 19 shall not refer the propounding party to documents included in other discovery but will identify each specific document which supports plaintiff’s specific contentions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Minute Order 3/3/2023, p. 12 of 13].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The supplemental response is now:</span></div><div>“Plaintiff identifies her financial bank statements from Bank of America from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018; January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019; January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 and January 1 -December 31, 2021.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Court has already found that there is no question that this interrogatory seeks information directly relevant to plaintiffs’ loss of income claim in this action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the supplemental responses, which only point to Bank of America checking account bank statements hardly show plaintiff’s loss of income, as plaintiff has failed to produce any business ledger, tax documents, invoices, accounts payable and accounts receivable records or profit/loss statements.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendants indicate that the documents identified are essentially only account summaries showing deposits or other credits, and withdrawals and other debits, without further specificity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This response does appear to be an incomplete response, and plaintiff is ordered one final time to provide a further verified response which identifies all responsive documents, so that if plaintiff seeks to introduce other documents at trial, there will be a clear record as to what was not identified in discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions&nbsp;</div><div>This leaves the issue of sanctions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>With respect to interrogatories, CCP § 2030.300 (d) provides that the court “shall impose a monetary sanction...against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a):&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Under CCP § 2023.010, misuse of the discovery process includes “(f) Making an evasive response to discovery,” and “(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”&nbsp; &nbsp; Where there has been a misuse of the discovery process, under Section 2023.030(a), the court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”</div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v.

Further monetary sanctions are awarded.&nbsp; The sanctions sought in each notice of motion, and supported by the declarations are $3,220.&nbsp; The declarations confusingly contain language which states, “Accordingly, [propounding party] will incur $3,220 on legal fees and costs for this motion, such that I request that Plaintiff only be sanctions in the amount of $2,560.”&nbsp; [Kelleher Decl., paras. 35]. The Court accordingly limits the monetary sanctions to $2,560 for each motion, which appear reasonable.&nbsp; Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motions, so have not challenged the reasonableness of the fees and costs incurred.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The motions also briefly seek that the court impose issue, evidence or terminating sanctions against plaintiff.&nbsp; Under CCP § 2030.300(e):&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“If a party then fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, and evidence sanction or a terminating sanction…”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiffs here did not fully comply with the court’s order, but did in fact serve further responses without objections, and defendant here has properly sought further responses which more fully comply with that court order, for which defendant’s efforts will be reimbursed with further monetary sanctions.&nbsp; To the extent defendant argues that plaintiffs have disobeyed the court’s previous order by failing to timely pay the previously awarded monetary sanctions, as noted above, under section 2023.010, “misuse of the discovery process” includes “(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”&nbsp; (emphasis added).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It has long been the rule that a trial court may not issue a terminating sanction based solely on the failure to pay a monetary sanction ordered in connection with a discovery motion.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Second District in Newland v Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608 reversed a trial court’s entry of default after striking an answer for a party’s failure to timely pay discovery sanctions, clearly holding “a terminating sanction issued solely because of the failure to pay a monetary sanction is never justified.”&nbsp; Newland, at 615.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Second District noted that such a sanction is not appropriately designed to encourage compliance with discovery obligations, raising questions of due process, and also observed that further punishment for failure to pay sanctions is unnecessary, observing:&nbsp;</div><div>“Nor is a terminating sanction necessary in order to enforce a monetary order. Weil and Brown observe that many attorneys seem to be unaware that monetary sanction orders are enforceable through the execution of judgment laws. (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial 3 (The Rutter Group 1994) PP 9:344.21, 9:344.22, p. 9(1)-92.) These orders have the force and effect of a money judgment, and are immediately enforceable through execution, except to the extent the trial court may order a stay of the sanction. (See § 680.230,&nbsp; 680.270, 699.510, subd. (a); Jones v. Otero, supra, 156 Cal. App. 3d at p. 759.) Unawareness of this remedy may explain why terminating sanctions are often sought when monetary sanctions are unpaid.”</div><div>Newland, at 615.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The request for issue, evidence or terminating sanctions accordingly is denied at this juncture, and only further monetary sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No Opposition]</div><div>UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Additional Further Supplemental Responses from Plaintiff Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc. as to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1, 4, and 19 is GRANTED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc. is ordered to serve further verified responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1, 4, and 19, which fully comply with the Court’s previous order of March 3, 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The further responses must provide all information requested in those interrogatories, and fully comply with the requirements under the Discovery Act, including, under CCP § 2030.210 (a)(1) answers “containing the information sought to be discovered.”&nbsp; The responding party must also comply fully with CCP § 2030.220:</div><div>“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.</div><div>(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.</div><div>(c) If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.”</div><div>The Court notes that all objections have been overruled, so that any further responses will continue to be made without objections.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1 and 4, the responses must include all facts which support plaintiff’s contentions, and all facts which support the conclusions set forth in the most recent responses, and must be directed at the conduct which plaintiff Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc. is alleging to have been engaged in by moving defendant, A &amp; D Fire Sprinklers, Inc.&nbsp; Again, the Court does not find acceptable a response that discovery is continuing or that plaintiff will supplement its response, given the duty imposed by CCP section 2030.220 to make reasonable inquiry before responding to an interrogatory.&nbsp; Further responses must not include the language, “Discovery is ongoing, and Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement her response to this request upon new and admissible information,” or any similar language.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Further response to Special Interrogatory No. 19 shall clearly identify all documents which support plaintiff’s loss of earnings claims, beyond the very summary bank account documents identified, so that documents not identified in response to the discovery can be properly excluded from introduction at trial.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Further verified responses to be served within ten days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Further monetary sanctions requested by moving party: Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $2,560.00 (12.8 hours @ $200/hour) (15.8 hours requested ), plus filing fees in the sum of $60 [Amount Requested $3,220/declaration limits to $2,560], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant A &amp; D Fire Sprinklers, Inc. and against plaintiff Neuro Diagnostic Center, Inc., payable within 30 days.

(Kwan v. Mercedes–Benz of North America, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 184, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371.) It is also consistent with the Department of Consumer Affairs' regulations which interpret the Act to protect “any individual to whom the vehicle is transferred during the duration of a written warranty.” (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 16, § 3396.1, subd.

Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1239, 8 Cal.Rptr.2d 298), BMW argues the Legislature could not have intended to grant protection to every used car with a balance remaining on the new car warranty because of the economic impact on consumers. Specifically, BMW maintains “[t]he subsequent owner would have the benefit of all of Song–Beverly's generous presumptions, without having undertaken the same risks as the purchaser of a really new car. Further, while the subsequent (perhaps third or fourth in the line of owners) will receive the benefit of these presumptions, the manufacturer will find it tremendously more difficult to raise defenses under Song–Beverly—such as the defense that the owner used the vehicle unreasonably—because it will be harder to trace multiple owners and determine their use or abuse of the vehicle.” BMW contends the increased costs will result in higher car prices or the shortening of warranties to the statutory minimum. It argues “[t]hese alternatives would inevitably result in a manifest decline in trade and commerce in this state, creating great inconvenience for consumers. It is impossible that the legislature intended this highly intractable result.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We acknowledge manufacturers such as BMW incur costs in honoring express warranties to service and repair the cars they sell in this state. We also presume the decision to offer a warranty of a specified length involves weighing the benefit of increased sales against the cost of providing service and repair for the effective duration of the warranty. It may be the equation factors in the impact of resale during the warranty period. However, as noted by BMW, manufacturers are free to change the terms of express warranties they offer. The Act merely reflects the Legislature's intent to make car manufacturers live up to their express warranties, whatever the duration of coverage.</div><div>Jensen, at 126-127, footnote omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This holding by the Third District court of appeal in Jensen, that the Song-Beverly Act applies to cars sold with a balance remaining on the new motor vehicle warranty, including used cars, has been consistently recognized since 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant relies on the Fourth District court of appeal’s 2022 decision in Rodriguez v.

FCA argues the phrase qualifies dealer-owned cars and demonstrators and thus refers to vehicles that, like those two types of vehicles, have not been previously sold and are sold with new or full warranties. FCA argues plaintiffs' interpretation is at odds with the rest of the Act's definition of “new motor vehicles.” While we acknowledge that in isolation the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” could arguably refer to any car sold with a manufacturer's warranty still in force, we agree with FCA that context clearly requires a more narrow interpretation. Context is a fundamental aspect of statutory interpretation, and here it's key to discerning the phrase's meaning. (Kirzhner, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 972, 266 Cal.Rptr.3d 346, 470 P.3d 56 [“We do not consider statutory language in isolation; instead, we examine the entire statute to construe the words in context”].)</div><div><br></div><div>To begin with, the phrase appears in a definition of new motor vehicles. That fact alone strongly suggests the Legislature did not intend the phrase to refer to used (i.e., previously sold) vehicles. But, more importantly, the phrase is preceded by “a dealer-owned vehicle and demonstrator,” which comprise a specific and narrow class of vehicles. Though they have not been previously sold to a consumer, demonstrators and dealer-owned cars are used in the sense that they will have been driven for various purposes before sale. As such, they will necessarily have more miles on their odometers than the typical vehicle in a dealer's new car inventory. What makes these vehicles unique is that even though they aren't technically new, manufacturers (or their dealer-representatives) treat them as such upon sale by providing the same type of manufacturer's warranty that accompanies new cars.</div><div><br></div><div>In other words, demonstrators and dealer-owned vehicles comprise a narrow category of basically new vehicles—they have never been previously sold to a consumer and they come with full express warranties. Given this context, we think the most natural interpretation of the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” is that it, too, refers to vehicles that have never been previously sold to a consumer and come with full express warranties.</div><div>Rodriguez, at 219-220, italics in original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal also addressed certain questions raised by interpreting the phrase to include vehicles with a manufacturer warranty remaining, such as, for example, whether a buyer who purchases a used car with only a few miles remaining on the original warranty would be entitled to the same protections as the original buyer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rodriguez, at 221.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court also considered the Act as a whole, and other references to used or previously owned products:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></span></div><div>“Our examination of the entire Act yields two additional reasons for concluding the phrase doesn't cover subsequent sales of vehicles with unexpired manufacturer's warranties. First, the Act defines “express warranty” as any “written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good pursuant to which the manufacturer ... undertakes to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the consumer good ....” (§ 1791.2, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) In plaintiffs' case, the limited powertrain warranty did not “aris[e] out of” the sale, it transferred to plaintiffs by operation of law along with title to the truck. The warranty arose from the initial sale to the truck's first buyer.</div><div><br></div><div>Second, as part of the Motor Vehicle Warranty Adjustment Programs (§§ 1795.90-1795.93), the Act requires manufacturers to notify all “consumers” of any warranty adjustments regarding safety or emissions-related recalls and defines “consumer” as “any person to whom the motor vehicle is transferred during the duration of an express warranty.” (§ 1795.90, subd. (a), italics added.) This definition of “consumer” indicates the Legislature is aware of the distinction between warranties that arise out of a sale and those that transfer to subsequent purchasers as a result of a sale. The lack of reference to transferred warranties in the definition of “new motor vehicle” suggests the Legislature made a deliberate choice not to include sales of used vehicles accompanied by unexpired express warranties.</div><div><br></div><div>Based on all of these textual reasons, we conclude the phrase “other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's new car warranty” unambiguously refers to cars that come with a new or full express warranty.”</div><div>Rodriguez, at 222.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court of appeal characterized the issue as one of first impression: “no California court has addressed whether a used car purchased from a retail seller unaffiliated with the manufacturer qualifies as a ‘new motor vehicle’ simply because there is some balance remaining on the manufacturer’s warranty.”&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 223.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Rodriguez court distinguished the Jensen case on the ground that factually the case involved a vehicle which had been represented to have been previously used as a demonstrator but had not in fact been used as a demonstrator, as the result of which the dealership leasing the vehicle to Jensen gave her a warranty “on top” of the miles already on the odometer.&nbsp; Rodriguez, at 223-224.&nbsp; The court of appeal reasoned that the Jensen case reached its conclusion when the manufacturer tried to use the fact that the vehicle had never actually been a demonstrator to its advantage.

Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.&nbsp; Plaintiff requests $897.50 plus a $60.00 filing fee for each of two motions, which does not appear unreasonable, and defendant has not challenged the time or billing rate sought.&nbsp; The sanctions are awarded as requested.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>[No opposition]</div><div>Plaintiff’s motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories:&nbsp;</div><div>The Motion Reservation was for one motion:&nbsp; a single motion to compel responses to discovery.&nbsp; Contrary to this reservation, plaintiff has combined two motions into one (1) a motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories—General (Set No One), and (2) a motion to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Two separate hearing dates should have been reserved for these two motions to compel.

Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 165, that if the moving party submits an unauthenticated agreement to meet its prima facie burden, “and the opposing party does not dispute the existence of the arbitration agreement,” then nothing more is required on the initial burden.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there have been objections asserted, and the court could find that defendant has failed to meet its initial burden sufficient to shift the burden to the party opposing arbitration to produce evidence of facts necessary to a defense.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, plaintiff in the opposition has not affirmatively asserted that plaintiff signatory never saw or signed the agreement, or does not remember seeing or signing the agreement, as the Second District suggested would be appropriate to defeat an authentication argument in Gamboa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, plaintiff in opposition submits what plaintiff authenticates as “a true and correct copy of the executed employment agreement,” including Exhibit C, which appears to be the same document submitted by defendant, only plaintiff’s document includes page numbers.

Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 114.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the burden of the party attempting to establish the unconscionability of an arbitration agreement to introduce sufficient evidence to establish unconscionability.&nbsp; Arguelles-Romero v. Superior Court (2010, 2nd Dist.) 184 Cal.App.4th 825, 843.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As explained by the California Supreme Court in Armendariz, this analysis requires a determination of whether an arbitration agreement is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>“We explained the judicially created doctrine of unconscionability in Scissor-Tail, supra, 28 Cal.3d 807.&nbsp; Unconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion. (Id. at pp. 817-819.) “The term [contract of adhesion] signifies a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.” (Neal v. State Farm Ins. Cos. (1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 690, 694 [10 Cal.Rptr. 781].) If the contract is adhesive, the court must then determine whether “other factors are present which, under established legal rules-legislative or judicial-operate to render it [unenforceable].” (Scissor-Tail, supra, 28 Cal.3d at p. 820, fn. omitted.)”</div><div>Armendariz, at 113.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Court further explained the analysis as follows:</span></div><div>“As explained in A &amp; M Produce Co., supra, 135 Cal.App.3d 473, “unconscionability has both a 'procedural' and a 'substantive' element,” the former focusing on “ 'oppression' ” or “ 'surprise' ” due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on “ 'overly harsh' ” or “ 'one-sided' ” results. (Id. at pp. 486-487.) “The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1533 (Stirlen).) But they need not be present in the same degree. “Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.” (15 Williston on Contracts (3d ed. 1972) § 1763A, pp. 226-227; see also A &amp; M Produce Co., supra, 135 Cal.App.3d at p. 487.) In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.”</div><div>Armendariz, at 114, italics in the original.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Procedural Unconscionability</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to procedural unconscionability, plaintiff argues that with respect to the transaction by which plaintiff accepted his employment, plaintiff was made an offer of employment, which he was pressured to swiftly accept, and which was conditioned on the execution of a standard employment agreement, which plaintiff had been advised included, for example, confidentiality provisions, but that plaintiff was not advised that the Employment Agreement included an Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It is recognized that preemployment arbitration contracts are generally adhesive, imposed on employees as a condition of employment with no opportunity to negotiate, and accompanied by the economic pressure of agreement standing between the employee and necessary employment.&nbsp; Armendariz, at 114-115.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff here submits his own declaration in which he explains the process by which he came to execute the Employment Agreement, and to also separately sign the Arbitration Agreement attached to the Employment Agreement.&nbsp; Specifically, plaintiff indicates that on August 28, 2020, “I received and accepted a written offer of employment from LegalZoom.”&nbsp; [Gupta Decl., para 6]. The letter attached includes the following language, “As a condition of your employment with the Company, you will be required to sign a standard employment agreement, which includes confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions.”&nbsp; [Gupta Decl., Ex. A, p. 2].&nbsp; There is no mention of an arbitration provision or agreement in the letter, which plaintiff signed and returned.&nbsp; [Id.]</span></div><div><br></div><div>On September 8, plaintiff reached out to the LegalZoon recruiting professional who had informed plaintiff that he had passed the background check about the next steps in the process, and was told that the employment agreement had been received, and would be sent along shortly, and that “with this document, there will be nothing further needed on your end.”&nbsp; [Gupta Decl., paras. 8-9, Ex. C].&nbsp; Plaintiff indicates that on that date LegalZoom sent, via DocuSign, the standard employment agreement for plaintiff to execute.&nbsp; [Gupta Decl., para. 10, Ex. D].&nbsp; Plaintiff states:</div><div>“11.&nbsp; Through DocuSign, each place that LegalZoom required me to sign was predesignated.</div><div><br></div><div>12.&nbsp; Since I had already agreed to and signed the August 28, 2020 offer letter and my point of contact had indicated that nothing further was needed from me, I had no choice, in my opinion, but to follow through and sign the employment agreement when I received it in order to begin working at LegalZoom.</div><div><br></div><div>13.&nbsp; It was my understanding that I was to sign each place indicated by LegalZoom through DocuSign so that I could start working at LegalZoom.&nbsp; I signed each place it was indicated in the DocuSign that I received….</div><div><br></div><div>14.&nbsp; Having already agreed to the terms of the offer letter and withdrawn from consideration for other positions, I wanted to make sure that I was signing everything correctly.&nbsp; To that end, when I came across a blank signature for which there was no option to sign, I reached out to the LegalZoom recruiting professional with whom I had been working with to make sure I was signing in the right places.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Gupta Decl., paras. 11-14].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It appears that the argument is that because plaintiff had not been advised in connection with the offer letter of any arbitration agreement, was expected to execute all parts of the Employment Agreement to secure his employment, and was faced with a situation with a DocuSign document which required signatures at certain places in order to have fully executed the document, plaintiff was placed in the position of having no choice but to accept and execute the Employment Agreement containing the arbitration provision and the Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff cites to Serpa v. California Surety Investigations, Inc. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 695, in which the Second District reversed the trial court’s order denying an employer’s motion to compel arbitration, and observed in connection with a preemployment arbitration agreement offered as a term of employment:</div><div>“The parties presented neither evidence nor argument that [the employee] had any opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement. Nonetheless, as we have explained, this adhesive aspect of an agreement is not dispositive. (Roman, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1471 &amp; fn. 2, 92 Cal.Rptr.3d 153.) When, as here, there is no other indication of oppression or surprise, “the degree of procedural unconscionability of an adhesion agreement is low, and the agreement will be enforceable unless the degree of substantive unconscionability is high.” (Ajamian v. CantorCO2e (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 771, 796, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 773; accord, Dotson v. Amgen, Inc.

Superior Court (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1462, in which the Second District observed:</div><div>“Roman contends the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was part of a contract of adhesion, that is, it was contained in a preprinted form prepared by the employer and presented to Roman on a take-it-or-leave-it basis with no opportunity to negotiate. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that adhesion contracts in the employment context typically contain some measure of procedural unconscionability. (See, e.g., Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 115, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669 [“[i]n the case of preemployment arbitration contracts, the economic pressure exerted by employers on all but the most sought-after employees may be particularly acute, for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary employment, and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration requirement”]; accord, Little, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1071, 130 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 63 P.3d 979.)</div><div><br></div><div>Here, there is no dispute that the arbitration agreement was part of an adhesion contract.&nbsp; Nonetheless, whatever procedural unfairness is inherent in an adhesion agreement in the employment context, it was limited in this case. The arbitration provision was not buried in a lengthy employment agreement. Rather, it was contained on the last page of a seven-page employment application, underneath the heading “Please Read Carefully, Initial Each Paragraph and Sign Below.” It was set forth in a separate, succinct (four-sentence) paragraph that Roman initialed, affirming she had seen it. (Cf. Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1252–1253, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 293 (Higgins ) [procedural unconscionability high when arbitration provision was buried in 24–page, single-spaced document and, “[a]lthough petitioners were required to place their initials in boxes adjacent to six other paragraphs, no box [for initials] appeared next to the arbitration provision”].)</div><div><br></div><div>In any event, whatever measure of procedural unconscionability may be present in this case involving an adhesive employment agreement between parties with unequal bargaining power, procedural unconscionability alone does not render an agreement unenforceable. There must also be some measure of substantive unconscionability. (Little, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1071, 130 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 63 P.3d 979; Armendariz, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 114, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669.)&nbsp;</div><div>Roman, at 1470-1471, footnote omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues there is no procedural unconscionability here in the form of oppression or surprise, focusing on the documents plaintiff signed, which are clear and plain in their terms, formatted with bold print, headings, and readable font, and hide nothing from plaintiff to support an argument plaintiff was surprised.&nbsp; The documents do include the language quoted above, clearly waiving the right to a jury trial.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that such language is buried in paragraph 6 of the arbitration procedures section, but this does not appear to be oppressive or invite surprise.&nbsp; The matter does not appear to fit within the case law relied upon by plaintiff, where it was recognized that significant oppression appeared from the document itself, in addition to the manner of its presentation.&nbsp; See OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019)&nbsp; &nbsp;8 Cal. 5th 111, 128 (document written “in extremely small font,” and “the sentences are complex, filled with statutory references and legal jargon.”)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant argues that its arguments concerning this lack of surprise or oppression apply with particular force here because plaintiff was highly educated, about to assume a Senior Director level position at LegalZoom, so cannot credibly argue he was surprised by any of the terms which he reviewed and to which he agreed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As quoted above, plaintiff indicates in his declaration that despite the pressure to complete the DocuSign process in connection with the Employment Agreement, plaintiff in fact paused in the process to direct a question to defendant’s recruiting professional regarding the execution of the document and the requirements of the process. [Gupta Decl., para. 14].&nbsp; &nbsp;The email attached shows that plaintiff Gupta inquired about a signature portion that did not have a live Docu sign on it, and asked if it was okay if that was not signed.&nbsp; The response was that the page was one on which a signature would be required when leaving the company.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Gupta Decl., Ex. E].&nbsp; It accordingly appears that plaintiff recognized that he had an avenue for asking questions about the process.&nbsp; It is not clear why he did not ask if he could opt out of the arbitration agreement, as he now indicates he would have if given an option.&nbsp; [See Gupta Decl., para. 16].&nbsp; &nbsp;That email, referring to plaintiff’s “recruiters,” as well as the balance of plaintiff’s declaration explaining the process of plaintiff pursuing employment with defendant while also pursuing other employment with companies seeking IPO assistance, suggests that plaintiff was possibly uniquely positioned as a prospective employee who was not without potential bargaining power here.&nbsp; [See Gupta Decl., paras. 4, 7, 14, Ex. E].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, defendant has not indicated that plaintiff was not in fact required to execute all portions of the “standard” Employment Agreement plaintiff reasonably believed he had already agreed to enter by executing the letter offer, and the use of the DocuSign mechanism for finalizing the transaction lends support to the take-it-or-leave-it nature of the agreement in the employment context.&nbsp; Neither side has cited case law addressing the effect of a DocuSign situation on the unconscionability analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the adhesive nature of the contract combined with the Arbitration Agreement creating a significant ambiguity concerning what substantive law applies, presents an even higher level of procedural unconscionability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, plaintiff relies on the following language from the Arbitration Agreement:</div><div>“This Arbitration Procedure shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Arbitration Act of the state where the Employee's primary office is located, California or Texas[.] This Addendum may be enforced and administered by a court of competent jurisdiction through the filing of a petition to compel arbitration; confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitration award; or otherwise pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration laws of the state in which the company is located or a combination of the two.”</div><div>[Ex.

In addition, the appellate court found not only that the arbitration agreement was a contract of adhesion, but that there was a “high degree of oppressiveness.” (Id. at p. 722, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 88.) As Fitz and the preceding cases show, the failure to attach the arbitration rules was of “minor significance to [the courts'] analysis” of procedural unconscionability. (Bigler v. Harker School (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 727, 737, 153 Cal.Rptr.3d 78 [finding no procedural unconscionability despite failure to provide a copy of AAA rules].)</div><div><br></div><div>Here, we conclude the failure to attach a copy of the AAA rules did not render the agreement procedurally unconscionable. There could be no surprise, as the arbitration rules referenced in the agreement were easily accessible to the parties—the AAA rules are available on the Internet. (See Boghos v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (2005) 36 Cal.4th 495, 505, fn. 6, 30 Cal.Rptr.3d 787, 115 P.3d 68 [full, up-to-date text of AAA rules is available on AAA's Internet site] ). In addition, Lane—a formerly well-paid professional analyst—does not appear to lack the means or capacity to locate and retrieve a copy of the referenced rules. Finally, the arbitration agreement at issue clearly specified a particular set of AAA rules, and it did not modify those rules in any manner. In the absence of oppression or surprise, we decline to find the failure to attach a copy of the AAA rules rendered the agreement procedurally unconscionable. (Cf. Dotson v. Amgen, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 975, 981, 104 Cal.Rptr.3d 341 [“Dotson is not an uneducated, low-wage employee without the ability to understand that he was agreeing to arbitration. He was the opposite—a highly educated attorney, who knowingly entered into a contract containing an arbitration provision in exchange for a generous compensation and benefits package. In such circumstances, the courts have found a minimum degree of procedural unconscionability.”].)</div><div>Lane, at 691.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>However, Lane was expressly distinguished in Carbajal:</span></div><div>“In Lane, the Court of Appeal concluded the failure to attach a copy of the governing AAA rules did not render the arbitration agreement procedurally unconscionable because the rules were available on the Internet, the employee was a sophisticated business person with the capacity to locate the rules, and the arbitration agreement “clearly specified a particular set of AAA rules” without modifying them. (Lane, supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at pp. 691–692, 168 Cal.Rptr.3d 800.) None of those factors are present here. Although AAA's rules are available online, Carbajal could not access them before signing the Agreement because she was not given time to do so and CW Painting did not “clearly specif[y]” which set of rules governed.”</div><div>Carbajal, at 245.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The problem here has two components.&nbsp; First, there is confusion generated by the language concerning which law will be applied, federal or California state law, regardless of the issue with respect to the arbitration rules.&nbsp; Second, as plaintiff points out, and which is evident to the court from a reading of the language, that the court itself would be hard pressed to understand which law to apply should a conflict, such as the conflict concerning the partiality of the arbitrator, arise.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to the arbitration rules to be applied, there is no mention of under which rules the arbitration will be conducted. The Arbitration Agreement states that if the parties are unable to choose an arbitrator within 30 days of a written notice of intent to arbitrate, “the party that initiated arbitration shall, within 15 days, request that a JAMS or AAA office located in the city in which the Company is located provide the parties with a list of seven retired judges for the JAMS or AAA employment list of arbitrators.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There is no mention of what rules would apply.&nbsp; This situation is accordingly not a case like Lane, where the arbitration agreement clearly specified a particular set of AAA rules, but a case like Carbajal, where the agreement does not clearly specify a particular set of rules, and the failure to identify rules prevents the employee from reviewing them before signing the arbitration agreement, or knowingly agreeing to their provisions.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>While defendant argues that this breadth of choice afforded plaintiff between JAMs and AAA undermines any procedural unconscionability argument, it is not clear which of the numerous AAA rules would be applied, or which JAMS rules would apply.&nbsp; Moreover, since the party “that initiated arbitration” is the party permitted to choose, it would appear in this case, and most cases where the employer seeks to enforce an arbitration agreement, that the employer would have the choice, not the employee. This posture appears to be another aspect of the agreement improperly tilting in favor of the employer.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Overall, plaintiff here has established at least a moderate level of procedural unconscionability, based on the adhesive nature of the contract, combined with the circumstances of its execution, the language concerning the applicable law to be applied, and the failure to specify the arbitration rules to be applied to permit the employee to locate and evaluate them.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Substantive Unconscionability&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Since procedural unconscionability has been established, the court then considers whether substantive unconscionability is established in sufficient measure to warrant an overall unconscionability finding.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Second District has summarized substantive unconscionability as follows:</span></div><div>“Substantive unconscionability addresses the fairness of the term in dispute.

(DBG) (collectively, “Applebee’s Enterprises”) reserved the right of general control over defendants Applebee’s Bar and its employees in their relevant day-to-day operations, and also controlled hiring, direction, supervision, discharge and relevant day-to-day behavior as it relates to the service of alcoholic beverages to customers, and were responsible for the conduct of its agents, and also owed duties to decedent that cannot be delegated arising from a special relationship, and involving a special or peculiar risk of harm, including the sale of alcoholic beverages to members of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges a cause of action for negligence/wrongful death.</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div><div>All of the named defendants seek an order changing the venue of this action from Los Angeles County to Santa Cruz County, where the subject premises are located.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants argue that the basis for venue in Los Angeles County, the residence of defendants Applebee’s Restaurants/ARLLC and DBG, should not be considered in determining venue, as these defendants were either fraudulently or improperly joined as defendants in this matter.&nbsp; Defendants argue that since those defendants were improperly joined, the question of venue must be evaluated based on defendant Applebee’s Bar/AMC and the individual defendants alone, so the case must be transferred out of Los Angeles County, and that since venue is proper in Santa Cruz County, and all witnesses live or are located there or near there, the case should be transferred to Santa Cruz County.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 395:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>“(a) Except as otherwise provided by law and subject to the power of the court to transfer actions or proceedings as provided in this title, the county in which the defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper county for the trial of the action.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants rely on the provision of the subdivision which states:</span></div><div>&nbsp;“If any person is improperly joined as a defendant or has been made a defendant solely for the purpose of having the action tried in the superior court in the county where he or she resides, his or her residence shall not be considered in determining the proper place for the trial of the action.”</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 395.5 provides:&nbsp;</div><div>“A corporation may be sued in the county where the contract was made or is to be performed, or where the obligation or liability arises, or the breach occurs; or in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation is situated, subject to the power of the court to change the place of trial as in other cases.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The memorandum argues that the case should be transferred to Santa Cruz County under CCP § 396b, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“…if an action or proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof, other than the court designated as the proper court for the trial thereof, under this title, the action may, notwithstanding, be tried in the court where commenced, unless the defendant…within the time otherwise allowed to respond to the complaint, files with the clerk, a notice of motion for an order transferring the action or proceeding to the proper court….&nbsp; Upon the hearing of the motion the court shall, if it appears that the action or proceeding was not commenced in the proper court, order the action or proceeding transferred to the proper court.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As stated in the statute, a motion for change of venue concedes that this action was commenced in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action but depends on a showing that this court is not designated, “under this title,” as a proper court for the trial of the action or proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It is held that plaintiff’s venue choice is ordinarily presumed to be proper, and that it is the burden of the moving party on a motion for change of venue, “to demonstrate that the plaintiff’s venue selection is not proper under any of the statutory grounds.”&nbsp; Fontaine v.

The declaration states that at the time the premises “were independently owned and operated” by the franchisee Apple Mid Cal II, LLC, not ARLLC or DBG, so that those defendants “bear no liability for the alleged incident were therefore not properly joined as defendants in the action.”&nbsp; [Darby Decl., paras. 2, 3].&nbsp; &nbsp;No independent documentation to support either of these declarations is submitted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A motion to transfer bears the burden of negating the propriety of venue on all possible grounds.&nbsp; Karson Industries, Inc. v.

In the latter regard, I make regular visits to my child’s pediatrician for her care. While on maternity leave, I am fully occupied with caring for my child. I also have 3 other young children and am occupied with caring for them as well. It would accordingly be a severe hardship for me to travel to Los Angeles County to defend myself against this action.

For example, the witness Jonathan Hershberger, the Safety and Security Manager for Planned Parenthood, “which took video of the accident,” would be expected to authenticate the video which shows the accident and explain the camera angles and provide other information necessary to interpretation of the video.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Rivera Decl., para. 3, no. 10].&nbsp; The detail provided is sufficient for this court to evaluate the facts supporting the issues, particularly at this early stage of the litigation, when plaintiffs evidently refused to extend the courtesy of permitting defendants any extension of time to plead beyond thirty days after service.&nbsp; [Rivera Decl., para. 2].&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The opposition also argues that inconvenience would take into account factors such as a witness’ poor health, or that travel would cause economic hardship.&nbsp; However, such factors are what is shown here.&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that the court will generally limit consideration of the inconvenience of witnesses to nonparty nonexpert witnesses, but such witnesses are discussed here, and plaintiffs have pointed to none of the identified witnesses who would be expected to be called as experts.&nbsp; As for party witnesses, defendant Valle has indicated she has issues including being on maternity leave tending to her newborn, with attendant medical appointments, not a minimal hardship.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also seems to argue that inconvenience is not established because remote appearances are commonplace in the post-COVID era, that depositions are regularly conducted remotely, and that “in the rare event that a witness is unable to appear, or travel would impose undue hardship on a witness, virtual appearances are commonplace throughout California.”&nbsp; This argument is not an offer of plaintiffs to accept remote appearances except in cases of inability to appear or undue hardship from travel, which does not alleviate the overall convenience concerns.&nbsp; The reply argues that this argument suggests that there would be little inconvenience to plaintiffs under such a scenario, as plaintiffs’ attorneys, who are located in Los Angeles County, would be better equipped to conduct business remotely in Santa Cruz County than most other interested parties in Santa Cruz County would be to participate remotely in proceedings in a distant County.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition does not explain what witnesses who reside in Los Angeles County would be called as witnesses for plaintiffs or explain their role or importance to the trial of this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;The opposition argues broadly that Los Angeles County is where decisions that govern, manage, regulate, and control all of Applebee’s restaurants throughout California, including the Watsonville Applebee’s, originate.&nbsp; While plaintiffs make this argument, they fail to indicate what witnesses who are located distant from Santa Cruz County will be necessary to appear at trial on this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Robbins as a 50/50 partner in an advertising and branding agency, which came to be known as Bird Design, Inc. (Bird).&nbsp; &nbsp;By 1998, the company had become profitable enough that the parties decided to invest in commercial real estate, and created a new company for the new enterprise, Lucas King, LLC (Lucas King).&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she did not set up a separate Lucas King email accounts, but used her Bird email accounts for communications relating to either company.</span></div><div><br></div><div>In 2017, Bird was dissolved pursuant to a Dissolution Agreement, which provided that all Bird creative and infrastructural data (Shared Assets) were assigned to and jointly owned by plaintiff and defendant, to be managed and stored by defendant and made available to plaintiff upon request, with defendant to provide plaintiff with prior written notification of any planned change in status or location of the Shared Assets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In 2018, defendant began urging plaintiff to sell the property held by Lucas King, but plaintiff did not desire to sell, but spoke of a buy-out. The parties could not agree on a price, and on June 2, 2020, defendant and the another interested party filed a lawsuit against plaintiff and Lucas King in Los Angeles Superior Court, which is currently pending as Case No. 20 STCV 20770.&nbsp; That lawsuit alleges that plaintiff De La Torre, as the sole manager of Lucas King, had abused her authority, looting the company for her own benefit, and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that on June 7, 2020, a couple of days after plaintiff was served with the Lucas King lawsuit, plaintiff suddenly lost access to her Bird email accounts.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that these were her primary email accounts, containing the vast majority of her communications with defendant relating to Lucas King, and contained all the emails plaintiff would need to counter plaintiff’s allegations in the Lucas King lawsuit.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff assumed her loss of access was some kind of error, and immediately contacted Google, the host of the accounts, but was never able to regain access.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that without access to her emails, refuting the Lucas King lawsuit turned into a nightmare, as plaintiff was forced to spend extra time and attorney’s fees to litigate her defense while attempting to recreate evidence to show that defendant’s claims against her were unfounded.&nbsp; &nbsp;This situation resulted in plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment being denied when the court found triable issues regarding a certain transaction that was undetailed and unsubstantiated by other written records, records that likely existed in plaintiff’s emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In November of 2021, plaintiff received interrogatory responses in the Lucas King lawsuit which revealed for the first time that it was defendant Robbins who removed plaintiff’s access to her emails, and plaintiff realized that her long-time business partner had surreptitiously locked her out of her email accounts so she could not access the emails she would need to defend herself against his lawsuit.&nbsp; Plaintiff demanded that defendant return control of her email account, but defendant refused, and instead sent a purportedly complete copy of her email accounts, which plaintiff alleges is insufficient.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that she will need access to her individual Bird email accounts as well as the overall administration account, to determine whether defendant deleted or altered emails critical to her defense.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that this conduct breached the Bird Dissolution Agreement, as well as the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and constitutes conversion of plaintiff’s email accounts.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on August 18, 2023, defendant filed a Notice of Related Case, indicating that this case is related to LASC Case No. 20 STCV20770, Fleming, et al. v.

The parties have made a disappointing showing regarding the state of discovery from the court file.&nbsp; The court’s file shows that on April 18, 2023, the Jury Trial was scheduled for 07/10/2023, which minute order expressly states, “All related dates and deadlines will be extended in accordance with the new trial date.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 4/18/2023, p. 2 of 2].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On June 16, 2023, the court denied an ex parte application to continue the hearing on a Motion for Summary Judgment and relief from five-year rule based on plaintiff’s counsel’s request to keep the same trial date.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also in the file a minute order dated June 29, 2023, in which the court states, “Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Jury Trial scheduled for 07/10/2023 is advanced to this date and continued to 09/11/2023…”&nbsp; The minute order also states, “All trial deadlines are extended, including discovery deadlines, and shall be governed by the new trial date.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 06/29/2023, p. 2 of 3].&nbsp; On July 3, 2023, the court heard an ex parte application for an order to specially set the trial and set the trial date on a date on or before July 21, 2023, which was granted, and the trial date set for July 17, 2023.&nbsp; [Minute Order 07/03/2023, p. 2 of 2].&nbsp; There is no mention made of continuing the discovery deadlines in that minute order.&nbsp; However, the court is of the view that the previous orders continuing the discovery deadlines to coordinate with the new trial dates resulted in no lapse of the discovery cut off dates, particularly when the trial date was advanced to July 17, 2023 from a later September 11, 2023 trial date, so that the discovery deadlines had not lapsed prior to that July 17, 2023 trial date, which has since been vacated.&nbsp; There accordingly does not appear to be any necessity to reopen discovery which has already been propounded and pursued at this juncture, as the discovery deadlines had been continued by the court.&nbsp; The court accordingly considers the motion heard on September 15, 2023 to have been made within the discovery deadlines as reflected by the court’s file.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In an abundance of caution, the court will consider defendants’ request in the alternative for an order extending the discovery cut off with respect to the expert deposition of Dr. Gazi to the date of the September 15, 2023 hearing.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2024.050(a), “on motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the initial trial date...”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP section 2024.050(b), the determination of this motion is in the trial court’s discretion, taking into consideration matters relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to, in pertinent part,:</span></div><div>“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery.&nbsp;</div><div>(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier.</div><div>(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party.”</div><div>CCP § 2024.050(b).</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants have argued in opposition to plaintiff’s recent discovery motions, that this procedure must be followed before a discovery motion in violation of the discovery cut off dates can be considered by the court.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In Pelton-Shepard Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, the court addressed a situation like the one presented here, where a motion to compel had been brought to be heard beyond fifteen days before the date initially set for trial after the trial date had been continued.&nbsp; The court of appeal found that the trial court’s decision to consider and grant the untimely motion to compel was an abuse of discretion, analyzing the statutory scheme and reasoning:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here, the trial court’s discretion to hear [the] motion to compel was governed by section 2024.020, which provided that (1) the last day for Pelton-Sheperd to have its motion to compel heard as a matter of right was October 31, 2005, and that (2) the postponement of the trial date did not ‘operate to reopen discover proceedings’ ‘except as provided in Section 2024.050'-- that is except upon a successful motion for leave to reopen discovery.&nbsp; Moreover, under section 2024.050, subdivision(b), the trial court’s discretion to grant such a motion was not unfettered, but could be exercised only upon ‘taking into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to ......the necessity and the reasons for the discovery’ and ‘the diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking ...the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that...the discovery motion was not heard earlier.’”&nbsp;</div><div>Pelton-Shepard, at 1587-1588 (italics in original).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The court of appeal held that because the trial court had not required the moving party to file a motion for leave under section 2024.050, there was no indication on the record that it had considered the appropriate factors and appropriately exercised its discretion. The court of appeal concluded:</div><div>“By simply hearing the motion to compel without first deciding whether discovery should be reopened for that purpose under all of the relevant circumstances, the trial court transgressed the confines of the applicable principles of law and thereby abused its discretion.”&nbsp;</div><div>Pelton-Shepard, at 1588.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, defendants have now brought this separate motion, and addressed the factors to be considered.&nbsp; First, with respect to the necessity and reasons for the discovery, defendants have established that they need the deposition of Dr. Gazi because this court explicitly relied on the declarations purportedly signed by Dr. Gazi to deny defendants’ motions for summary judgment on the issue of medical negligence and causation.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., para. 9].&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to the diligence of the party seeking the discovery or hearing, defendants have shown that they have been diligent in seeking the discovery, having noticed the deposition prior to the latest date which would have closed expert discovery, and having had to bring multiple motions to compel the deposition when plaintiff repeatedly resisted producing the witness for an in person deposition, based on various representations concerning the whereabouts of the witness, which kept changing, and with which this court is very familiar.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., paras. 5-9].&nbsp; The parties also specially sought from the court dates in advance of those available on the court reservation system to have the hearings take place promptly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants also argue that the completion of this single deposition will not delay the trial, as Dr. Gazi is solely providing expert testimony that was already owed to defendants based on his expert declarations produced in this case many months ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;The file also shows that the matter is not yet re-set for trial, as a long-cause application is in the process of being considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion accordingly is granted, and defendants permitted to have motions heard and conduct Dr. Gazi’s deposition after the expiration of the original discovery cut-off date, and the discovery cut-off date for this discovery will be ordered to be measured from the new trial date, when set.&nbsp; &nbsp;This results in the court’s order of September 15, 2023 becoming the final order of the court with respect to compelling the resumption of the deposition of Dr. Gazi and his further testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied, as there is nothing to clarify, as the trial date has been vacated, seeming to argue that there is no expert discovery cut-off issue, further confirming that plaintiff will suffer no prejudice if the relief is granted.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff also argues that if the court is inclined to enter a schedule, it should set a new trial date and create a fair deadline for discovery and motions which are reciprocal and mutual.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, plaintiff has been permitted the opportunity to bring a noticed motion to reopen discovery, and make a proper showing under the discovery statutes according to the required factors.&nbsp; The opposition here does not satisfy the requirements of seeking such relief and makes no showing as to plaintiff’s necessity for discovery or diligence upon which the court could grant relief, which in any case is not properly sought in opposition papers.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendants’ motion is granted as set forth above.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Motions to Compel Depositions</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Motions Brought After Discovery Cut-Off&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff brings two similar motions to compel the deposition of the Person Most Qualified and production of documents, one for defendant Olympus America Inc. (Olympus) and one for third party Olympus Corporation of the Americas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Olympus has opposed the motions, first arguing that the motions are untimely, as fact discovery cut-off expired on June 10, 2023, if not earlier, when the trial was set for July 10, 2023.&nbsp; Defendant bases this argument on the Hoffman Declaration, which states that fact discovery was cut-off on at least June 10, 2023 (evidently 30 days before the July 10, 2023 trial date), without reference to any supporting evidence.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., para. 17].&nbsp; As discussed in detail above, the July 10, 2023 trial date was continued by a minute order dated June 29, 2023, in which “Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Jury Trial scheduled for 07/10/2023 is advanced to this date and continued to 09/11/2023…,”&nbsp; which minute order expressly states, “All trial deadlines are extended, including discovery deadlines, and shall be governed by the new trial date.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 06/29/2023, p. 2 of 3].&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant has accordingly failed to establish that the discovery cut-off had expired as alleged and not been extended by the direct order of the court.&nbsp; The motions accordingly are not denied on this ground.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Stay</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also argues that the motion is improperly brought while this matter is stayed pursuant to CCP section 583.340 (c), in connection with the 5-year deadline.&nbsp; However, the minute order relied upon is one in which the court did not stay the action, but determined,” that it is impossible, impracticable and futile to bring the case to try as scheduled,” and ordering that time be excluded from the time to bring the case to trial.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., paras. 21, 22; Ex. H, Minute Order 07/17/2023, p. 1 of 2].&nbsp; There is no mention of a stay, and the motions are not denied on this ground.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Substantive</div><div>CCP section 2025.450 (a) provides that”:</div><div>"if after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party...&nbsp; without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice... the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 2025.230:&nbsp;</div><div>“If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested.&nbsp; In that event the deponent shall designate and produce at deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the deponent.”</div><div><br></div><div>In this case, defendants were served with deposition notices for a deposition of the person most qualified from defendants Olympus America, Inc. and a separate entity, Olympus Corporation of the Americas, on August 2, 2023.&nbsp; [Lindemann Decl., Exs. 1, 3]. Written objections were served on August 9, 2023.&nbsp; [Exs. 2, 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As an initial matter, defendant Olympus argues that the witness Olympus Corporation of the Americas (OCA) is not a party to this action and has not been served in the action.&nbsp; Defendant indicates that despite naming OCA as a defendant in the First Amended Complaint, and explaining how he could serve that entity, plaintiff has never actually served that entity.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., paras. 2, 9, Ex. A].&nbsp; Defendant argues that plaintiff’s moving papers provide no evidence that plaintiff served OCA with a subpoena, and do not suggest that plaintiff validly served OCA with the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in reply argues that OCA was sued by a fictitious name, with the Amendment to Complaint identifying Olympus as “Olympus America, Inc. dba Olympus Corporation of the Americas,” which plaintiff argues was clearly a clerical error, and can be corrected at any time before judgment.&nbsp; Plaintiff accordingly appears to concede that this entity has not been served with summons and complaint, so the court has no personal jurisdiction over OCA.&nbsp; Plaintiff also appears to concede that this entity has not been served with a subpoena as required to obtain jurisdiction over a third party for deposition.&nbsp; See CCP section 2020.010 (“the process by which a nonparty is required to provide discovery is a deposition subpoena”).&nbsp; It also appears that plaintiff has not yet taken any formal action to correct any purported “clerical error.”&nbsp; The motion as to OCA accordingly is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to Olympus, the deposition notice indicates that the matters for examination will be the means and authenticity, identity of persons preparing, and locations of documents and things “identified below.”&nbsp; The documents include those identified on a privilege log, as well as documents relating to communications with affiliates, or documents created relating to testing data as to the subject scopes, as well as communications with expert witnesses, other defendants, and American Medical Forensics Specialists, among others.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to compelling a deposition of a person most qualified, Olympus has argued only briefly that this would be improper, as the notice fails to properly identify the topics to be addressed, however, a review of the notice shows that the topic is the various facts surrounding the documents and things requested, which appears appropriate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Olympus variously argues that the motion is untimely or is actually a motion for reconsideration of a March 10, 2023 order concerning discovery.&nbsp; The motion appears to be made in conjunction with a deposition notice served on August 2, 2023, well after the March 10, 2023 order.&nbsp; The opposition does not explain how the current discovery involves the same or duplicative discovery as that addressed by the previous motion.&nbsp; With respect to timeliness, under CCP section 2025.450 (a), quoted above, there is no time limit in the statute for bringing a motion for failure to appear and bring documents to a deposition.&nbsp; As argued in the reply, even if the court were to apply a time limit for compelling document production in connection with a motion to compel further answers at a deposition, under CCP§ 2025.480, that time limit would be “60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition.”&nbsp; Here, the deposition notice was served on August 2, 2023, and this motion served and filed on August 28, 2023, well within sixty days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There also appears to be an objection that the separate statement does not include the deposition topic or objections.&nbsp; The court has reviewed the deposition topic and objections and finds that no reason has been established to deny the deposition on this ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling the appearance and testimony of defendant Olympus pursuant to the deposition notice, and the motion is granted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the documents requested, the separate statement is sufficiently complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request No. 1, requesting documents previously identified in a privilege log, appears to improperly seek documents claimed to be privileged by attorney-client or work product privilege, and the log appears appropriate.&nbsp; The opposition supports the claims of privilege, and the moving party fails to point to particular document descriptions or arguments by defendant which would overcome the claim of privilege.&nbsp; [See Privilege Log; Segan Decl., paras. 2-12].&nbsp; The motion as to this request is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court is also not convinced that Request No. 9, seeking documents in other lawsuits, is sufficiently connected to this action.&nbsp; [Hoffman Decl., para. 15].&nbsp; The motion as to this request also is denied.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As to the remaining requests, it appears sufficiently demonstrated by plaintiff that these seek discoverable materials.&nbsp; The opposition argues that the requests are overly broad, seeking information in some cases spanning more than ten years.&nbsp; The Court will make limited limitations on the time frame of the document requests, where appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court will also in connection with certain requests limit the requests for communications to those concerning matters involved in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also appears to sufficiently argue that production of documents relating to the TJF-Q180V duodenoscope would not involve a scope which was used on plaintiff, and that there would be a burden of 100 hours and over $20,000 in data costs to produce this information, so that this information will not be required to be produced.&nbsp; [See Hoffman Decl., paras. 14, 15].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Sanctions</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Both sides seek monetary sanctions.&nbsp; Under CCP section 2025.450 (g)(1) “if a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent..., unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion against OCA is denied, and no sanctions are authorized by statute for successfully opposing such a motion, so no sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion against Olympus will be granted for the most part.&nbsp; However, the court will find that Olympus was substantially justified in opposing the motion, particularly given the confusion concerning the status of the discovery cut-off dates and deadlines.&nbsp; &nbsp;No sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Motion to Augment&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff has filed a motion seeking to augment his expert witness list to add two experts, Alan Lipschultz and Michael G. Koehler.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff indicates that these two witnesses are providing expert testimony in a civil matter against Olympus in the USDC of Georgia, which involves similar contentions that a similar scope led to a vector transmission.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>According to the report in that other case submitted by plaintiff here,&nbsp;</span></div><div>Dr. Koehler is an expert in chemistry, polymeric materials, and plastics, and consults from a chemistry and materials perspective.&nbsp; He has Bachelor of Science degrees in Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science, and a PhD in Medicinal Chemistry.&nbsp; He does not appear to be a medical doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff has also submitted a deposition transcript from the other case of a deposition of Alan Lipschultz, which evidently does not include testimony concerning the witness’ qualifications to testify as an expert but involves opinions concerning Olympus’ notice of problems with its scopes and its duties which arose with respect to rebutting findings or giving notice.&nbsp; The testimony includes testimony that the witness is not a medical doctor.&nbsp; [Lindemann Decl., Ex. B, Lipschultz Depo., p. 19:6-8].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that there have been odd and extraordinary circumstances surrounding certain designated experts, which may affect the availability of one or mor experts, and that after Dr. Gazi’s deposition, plaintiff’s counsel retained the two experts in August of 2023.&nbsp;

Plaintiff argues the Olympus has not relied on the original designation, as other expert witnesses currently designated have provided opinions on the scopes at issue in this case, so this is not a new topic of designation.&nbsp; Plaintiff also argues that Olympus will not be prejudiced, as the new experts are providing opinions in the Georgia federal action concerning very similar scopes, and pro hac vice counsel in this very case has taken their depositions.&nbsp; Plaintiff also notes that there is no trial date set in this matter, so that there is time to depose the witnesses and prepare, and that all other experts have had their deposition completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">		</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Plaintiff also seems to argue that plaintiff through reasonable diligence could not have designated these witnesses, as due to the availability and testimony of certain witnesses, as well as the conduct of certain witnesses, it has become necessary to augment to provide testimony of witnesses who have provided more certain analysis and evaluations of the issue of the safety of the scopes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Plaintiff indicates he has sought leave to augment promptly, within weeks of retaining and providing source materials to the witnesses and agrees to serve a supplemental designation of Alan Lipschultz and Michael G. Koehler by September 18, 2023 or one court day after the motion is heard pursuant to CCP section 2034.620(c).&nbsp; &nbsp;It does not appear from the file that such a supplemental designation or declaration has yet been filed or served, and no mention is made of it in the reply.&nbsp; The court will order that a code compliant declaration be served and filed “promptly” under the statute upon the granting of the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Plaintiff seems to argue in the reply that the augmentation is necessary because plaintiff’s expert Dr. Gazi has engaged in shocking, surprising, and strangely uncooperative behavior, necessitating the augmentation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The motion cites to Dickison v. Howen (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1471, in which the court of appeal upheld a trial court’s granting of a motion to augment under former CCP section 2034, holding that sufficient surprise was shown where a defendant’s expert gave deposition testimony damaging to defendant.&nbsp; The court rejected plaintiff’s arguments of prejudice, setting a high standard for showing such prejudice:</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>“We read this statute to evidence a concern with prejudicing the party opposing the motion by adding a new expert for which that party, due to its reliance on the previous list of experts, is not prepared and cannot be prepared in time.&nbsp; A party is not ‘prejudiced’ simply because the new expert will give testimony adverse to the party.</span></div><div>Dickison at 1479.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>The opposition argues that permitting augmentation now would violate the five-year rule, but as discussed above, the matter is currently in a posture not where the matter is stayed, but where the court has made a finding concerning the current ability to bring the case to trial given the delay in obtaining a long-cause determination.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also argues that the motion should be denied because the court has previously denied a request by plaintiff to augment his expert witness list.&nbsp; Defendants rely on the transcript from an ex parte application, in which the court denied an ex parte application to augment, which defendants concede related to the addition of a completely different expert and was made on an ex parte basis.&nbsp; [See Hoffman Decl., Ex. 1, p. 5:16-19].</div><div>As argued in the reply, that ruling does not foreclose the court considering or granting a new noticed motion to augment to add different expert witnesses on specific statutory grounds, based on more recent events in the action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also argues that plaintiff has failed to successfully move to reopen discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;As discussed above, it is disappointing that plaintiff has not filed a motion to ensure that discovery will be viewed as remaining open, but this court in reviewing the file has determined that it has ordered the discovery deadlines measured from the most recent trial date, and with the trial dates having been vacated pending the long cause determination, is prepared to view the court’s orders as extending the cut off to correspond to the new trial, when set.&nbsp; The court will also consider entering an order retroactively determining that expert discovery remains open with all deadlines to be measured from the new trial date, when set. The motion is not denied on the basis that the discovery cut-off has expired or that the motion does not fall within the time limitations of CCP section 2034.610.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the merits of the motion, the opposition argues that plaintiff does not satisfy the requirements of CCP section 2034.620, as Olympus has significantly relied on plaintiff’s expert witness list since it was disclosed over three months ago and did not designate supplemental experts since Olympus’ designated experts already covered the topics listed in the original witness list.&nbsp; If the augmentation should provide a circumstance where supplemental experts are necessary, this can be easily permitted by the court, particularly given the lack of a current trial date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition seems to argue that the new experts will inject new issues into this case regarding materials such as polymers, plastics, and coating, the expertise of Koehler, which issues have never been raised before.&nbsp; However, the issues are directed to the safety of the subject scopes, and plaintiff indicates the opinions will concern that issue, which has long been the heart of plaintiff’s claims against defendant Olympus.&nbsp; Moreover, any variation in the details of the analysis could be addressed by defendants’ designation of supplemental experts.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The opposition also argues that the motion must be denied because defendants would suffer extreme prejudice, arguing that the trial of this case should have concluded in July of 2023, and there is no time to derail this case for further expert depositions, or for Olympus to obtain rebuttal experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Plaintiff has cited case law in which it has been suggested that where the augmentation is limited with respect to witnesses and a limited subject matter, such a motion may be granted even during trial, as the expert’s testimony can be taken after court hours to avoid disrupting the trial proceedings.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Kennemur v. State of California (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 907, 920.&nbsp; &nbsp;As noted above, the court in Dickison held that the opposing party is not “prejudiced” simply because the new expert will give testimony adverse to the party; the focus should be on the opposing party’s ability to respond to the new testimony.&nbsp; Dickison, at 1479-1480.&nbsp; Again, the statute requires a finding that “any party opposing the motion will not be prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.”&nbsp; (Emphasis added).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>It accordingly appears under the statute and its interpretation that unless defendant can argue that the delay here has rendered it such that defendant cannot respond to the new testimony, such as that evidence has been lost or destroyed, or that this request is only a tactical decision amounting to bad faith by plaintiff, the motion should be granted.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Kennemur, at 920.&nbsp; Defendant has made no such showing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>Moreover, the circumstance of Dr. Gazi’s conduct in connection with scheduling and appearing at his deposition has contributed to the situation, which has recently escalated, and which defendants have been closely following and pursuing, further strengthening plaintiff’s arguments concerning diligence and potential surprise which can at this juncture be addressed to avoid the risk of any prejudice to defendants in maintaining their defense on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>The motion accordingly is granted.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The Court will hear argument concerning the submission of the required declaration, the scheduling of depositions on dates certain, and orders permitting defendants a period within which to designate counter-experts, if necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Defendants’ Joint Motion for Court to Clarify its September 15, 2023 Comments Regarding the Discovery Cutoff or, in the Alternative, to Reopen Discovery to Allow Completion of Only the Deposition of Plaintiff’s Expert Tawhid Gazi, M.D</div><div><br></div><div>Motion to Reopen Discovery to Allow Completion of the Deposition of Plaintiff’s Expert Tawhid Gazi, M.D. is GRANTED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court finds that a review of the Court’s file show that the relevant trial continuances were accompanied by language in the Court’s minute orders continuing the discovery deadlines to be measured from the new trial dates, so that the subject discovery remained open during the time it was being pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court further finds that even if there is some confusion concerning the discovery deadlines, that defendants sufficiently have established that the subject discovery, the deposition of Dr. Gazi, is necessary expert deposition discovery, that defendants have been diligent in seeking the deposition, and that permitting the discovery will not prevent the case from going to trial on the date which has not yet been set.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court permits expert deposition discovery of Dr. Gazi to be conducted and heard in this matter after the purported expiration of the discovery cut-off.&nbsp; &nbsp;The discovery cut-off on the deposition of Dr. Gazi will be measured from the new trial date, which has not yet been set.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court’s order of September 15, 2023 becomes the final order of the Court, and the deposition of plaintiff’s expert Dr. Gazi is ordered to be conducted on or before September 29, 2023.&nbsp;
