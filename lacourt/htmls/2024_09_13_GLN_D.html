&nbsp;Ivy Fung was the Trustee, with successor Trustees being plaintiff and/or Marie Bernardini.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Trust was created by Ivy Fung after she was diagnosed with terminal illness, and was revocable until her death, after which the Trust became irrevocable and all Trust property was to be handed over to her only child and next of kin, plaintiff Ado.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ivy Fung transferred her real property in La Crescenta to the Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that Marie Bernardini had been named as a successor trustee by connections between Ivy Fung, Bernardini, defendant Chaba Monari and defendant Church of Scientology.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that trust funds were used to pay defendant Monari over $200,000 a year from 2016-2017, and that following the death of Ivy Fung, Marie Bernardini began encumbering the property with loans facilitated by other defendants, used trust funds and loans to pay off her personal obligations, transferred funds to her company defendant Realty Home Solutions, and that following Marie Bernardini’s death, Bernardini’s husband defendant Jim Cox sold the property to a bona fide purchaser.&nbsp; The trust was depleted of all funds with the exception of $3,000.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint also alleges that defendant Cox removed personal property of Ivy Fung from the property, including expensive jewelry.&nbsp; &nbsp;The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, conversion, and negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on October 6, 2022, the court heard an OSC re: Default Judgment/Default Prove Up, at which the court was informed that defendant Jim Cox Sr. was deceased, with decedent’s son, James Cox Jr. being present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the OSC discharged and stayed the case “in its entirety, pending the disposition of the probate case.”</div><div><br></div><div>On September 11, 2023, the court conducted a Status Conference Re: Stay/Probate Case/Status of Successor in Interest, at which Travis Cox, son of decedent, was present in court.&nbsp; The court ordered the stay previously ordered to remain in full force and effect pending a hearing on a motion substituting Travis Cox as a party defendant in this action in place of defendant Jim Cox, deceased, in his capacity as Personal Representative of the Estate of Jim Cox.</div><div><br></div><div>On January 26, 2024, the motion was granted, and Travis Cox was substituted as defendant for Jim Cox III.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The matter remained subject to a stay until May 8, 2024, when at a Status Conference the court found that the Probate Court had rejected plaintiff’s creditor’s claim pursuant to Probate Code Section 925 and lifted the stay.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on October 30, 2023, plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, amending the complaint by substituting the true name of Sean Cox for the fictitious name of defendant Doe 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural</div><div>Untimely Opposition&nbsp;</div><div>Under CCP §1005(b):</div><div>“All papers opposing a motion…shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days… before the hearing.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CRC Rule 3.1300(d), “If the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the opposition was filed and served on September 3, 2024 for a September 13, 2024 hearing date.&nbsp; Taking into account the Labor Day court holiday, nine court days before the hearing fell on August 30, 2024.&nbsp; The opposition was accordingly filed one court day late (three calendar days).&nbsp; This situation has been inconvenient for the court and the courtroom staff, and unfair to the moving parties who have been deprived of that court day within which to file timely reply.&nbsp; The court, in its discretion, could refuse to consider the untimely opposition.&nbsp; The court will consider the opposition, but defendant is cautioned that in the future the court may refuse to consider papers not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Substantive&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Sean Cox, added to this action by Amendment to Complaint, substituting defendant’s name for Doe 1, brings this motion in reliance on CCP section 430.10, relying specifically on the following provisions of that statute:</div><div>“The party against whom a complaint ... has been filed may object, by demurrer...to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:</div><div>(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading….</div><div>(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues, evidently pursuant to subdivision (a), that the complaint fails to properly include defendant Sean Cox as a party, as defendant has not been properly served with the amended complaint, as under CCP section 583.210 (a), a defendant must be served within three years after the action is commenced.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The motion relies on CCP § 583.210(a), which provides:</div><div>“(a) The summons and complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision, an action is commenced at the time the complaint is filed.”</div><div>Under CCP § 583.250:</div><div>“(a) If service is not made in an action within the time prescribed in this article:</div><div>(1) The action shall not be further prosecuted and no further proceedings shall be held in the action.</div><div>(2) The action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on motion of any person interested in the action, whether named as a party or not, after notice to the parties.</div><div>(b) The requirements of this article are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by statute.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint in this action was filed on October 14, 2021.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>On October 30, 2023, plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, amending the complaint by substituting the true name of Sean Cox for the fictitious name of Doe 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP §474, “When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint... and such defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly...”&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This statutory procedure effectively extends the statute of limitations until expiration of the time for service of summons, in effect, to three years after the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp; CCP § 583.210(a); Sobeck &amp; Associates, Inc. v. B &amp; R Investments No. 24 (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 861, 869-870.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff has filed a proof of service of summons, showing service of the summons, Complaint for Damages, and Amendment to Complaint on Sean Cox by personal service on July 15, 2024.&nbsp; This time frame is well within three years of the filing of the action on October 14, 2021.&nbsp; Even if the service had been beyond the three-year period, it is questionable if a demurrer for lack of jurisdiction over the “subject of the cause of action” would be the proper ground for demurrer, as the statutory scheme appears to require a motion to dismiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, the motion affirmatively acknowledges not only that the service was effected two years and nine months after filing of the action, not more than three years, but also that the matter has been subject to a stay.&nbsp; &nbsp;Under CCP section 583.240, the time during which an action is stayed is excluded when computing the time within which summons must be served:</div><div>“In computing the time within which service must be made pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed:</div><div>(b) The prosecution of the action or proceeding in the action was stayed and the stay affected service.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, this action was stayed in its entirety beginning on October 6, 2022, and extending to May 8, 2024.&nbsp; Accordingly, on top of the service actually clearly falling within the three-year period, there was a significant period when this action was stayed, further excluding time to be counted toward the three-year deadline.&nbsp; The demurrer on this ground is overruled.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that defendant has not been properly served with the amended complaint.&nbsp; This argument is somewhat confusing, as there is no amended complaint to be served.&nbsp; The file shows from the proof of service that the operative complaint in this matter was in fact personally served on defendant.&nbsp; There is nothing here from the face of the pleading or anything of which this court may take judicial notice that would suggest that service was not effected as represented, so a demurrer on this ground also is improper.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 430.30(a), an objection to a pleading may be taken by a demurrer "[w]hen any ground for objection to a complaint...appears on the face thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial notice…"&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Certainly, a demurrer on the ground the court lacks jurisdiction over the “subject” of a cause of action is not supported by such an argument, even if it were properly before the court, as the argument would go to personal jurisdiction over the moving defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As pointed out in the opposition, any challenge to personal jurisdiction or the sufficiency of service of process to secure that jurisdiction should have been made by a timely motion to quash service of summons, accompanied by an evidentiary showing supporting an argument that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over defendant.&nbsp; See CCP section 418.10 (“(a) A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.);&nbsp; Mihlon v. Superior Court (1985, 2nd Dist.) 169 Cal.App.3d 703, 710; Evangelize China Fellowship, Inc. v. Evangelize China Fellowship (1983, 2nd Dist.) 146 Cal.App.3d 440, 444.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;To the extent the demurrer “demands” that plaintiff file a motion for leave to amend the complaint to properly include Sean Cox, and then to re-serve defendant with the amended complaint, there is no cognizable legal argument with respect to why the Amendment to Complaint to substitute defendant as a Doe was not properly employed here.&nbsp; &nbsp;The demurrer on this ground is overruled, and any such “demand” is not properly made or granted on a demurrer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues, without specifics, that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against defendant Sean Cox, as defendant is alleged to be a Doe defendant, but the complaint is devoid of any allegations whatsoever that would form a basis of a cause of action against Sean Cox.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that the demurrer challenges the utilization of Doe Amendment to bring defendant into the action but does not address specific claims or causes of action to argue how they are insufficiently alleged to support a cause of action of claim against the moving defendant or Doe 1.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer on this basis is not ideal, as defendant does not even attempt to identify specific elements of a cause of action or allegations that are missing from the complaint as to the moving defendant.&nbsp; However, a review of the complaint shows that the Doe defendants are mentioned only in the general allegations concerning the parties, as agents or employees of the other named defendants.&nbsp; [Complaint, para. 14].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although the complaint headings indicate that the first cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, second cause of action for conspiracy, and third cause of action for conversion is brought against the “Does,” the causes of action themselves mention named defendants and their conduct, without any mention whatsoever of the involvement or nature of the conduct undertaken by any Doe defendants.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the court finds it appropriate to sustain the demurrer to these causes of action with leave to amend to supply allegations directed at defendant Sean Cox, as substituted for Doe 1.&nbsp;

Once the remodeling was complete, the property would be sold by defendant Assali acting as the selling agent, or rented out, and plaintiff would receive the net profit from the sale of each property.&nbsp; It was also agreed that invoices for all expenses would be provided to plaintiff, and that plaintiff could demand the return of his investment at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff formed and registered CARP Property, LLC to purchase properties to be remodeled and sold.&nbsp; After two successful property flips, defendant Assali insisted that CARP Property, LLC no longer be used to purchase the investment properties, but that all future transactions should go through defendant personally or through his corporation, defendant UASA, LLC. Plaintiff agreed to this modification of the terms of the original agreement.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The complaint alleges that plaintiff transferred further funds to Assali to be used to purchase two properties in Long Beach, and further funds were provided for Long Beach flip supplies and a porch add on, but Assali did not provide plaintiff with any of the profits from the sale of the properties being flipped, insisting that the profits be added to the original investment to have more capital to purchase more properties, or higher valued properties.&nbsp; Sometime thereafter, defendant stopped sharing details of the properties with plaintiff.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff alleges that in December of 2018, a property in Glendale was successfully flipped, and that, upon information and belief, from 2018 to 2020, Assali purchased multiple properties that were eventually sold for a profit. When Assali’s communications with plaintiff became inconsistent and defendant stopped involving plaintiff in the details of the properties being purchased and sold, plaintiff requested that Assali repay plaintiff whatever plaintiff was owed.&nbsp; After making three payments through UASA, LLC to either CARP Property LLC or to plaintiff, Assali claimed he was not able to return the remaining funds owed to plaintiff and that he would return the money on the next property flips. Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff has made multiple demands for Assali to return the amount owed to plaintiff, but Assali has refused to return plaintiff’s money, and ignored plaintiff’s demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff Rafi Tarakjian seeks to compel the production of documents called for in the deposition notice served on defendants George Assali, which defendant did not object to and did not produce at deposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The deposition was duly noticed, with the Notice of Deposition requesting the production of 75 categories of documents.&nbsp; [Ex. A].&nbsp; Plaintiff did not object in writing to the Notice of Deposition or any of the requests for documents.&nbsp; [Yacoubian Decl., para. 3].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that during the deposition, it became apparent that Assali failed to produce documents in his possession which were responsive to five of the requests, as confirmed by plaintiff’s testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party..., without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The moving papers sufficiently establish that the deponent, who is a party to the action, was served with a deposition notice, and did not serve objections to the deposition notice, and failed to produce for inspection documents described in the deposition notice.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Under CCP § 2025.450 (b):</div><div>“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:</div><div>(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.</div><div>(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”</div><div>The burden is on the moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997, 2nd Dist.) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once good cause is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996, 2nd Dist.) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.</div><div><br></div><div>Good cause is shown when a moving party provides a fact-specific showing of relevance.&nbsp; Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002, 2nd Dist.) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Requests Nos. 7 and 73</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>These requests seek “Each and every COMMUNICATION, including text messages or social media COMMUNICATIONS with MR.

C, pp. 140-141].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>During that exchange, counsel for plaintiff indicated that documents had been produced to plaintiff by former counsel for defendant, but in a non-native format, and requested that they be produced in native format so that the date of creation of the documents could be confirmed.&nbsp; &nbsp;[Ex. C., p. 140-142].&nbsp; Counsel for the deponent agreed, stating “Sure,” and requested that if there were any other requests like that counsel for plaintiff send an email.&nbsp; [Ex. C., p. 142].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff in the motion does not appear to seek these documents in native format but appears to seek production of the documents in the first instance.&nbsp; It is not clear, but the request appears to be that, although profit and loss statements had been produced in response to other discoveries, they now be produced again in response to the deposition notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As discussed above, defendant in opposition appears to object to producing documents in native format, as not required under the code, and as not applying to text messages.&nbsp; The argument that the parties communicated only via text message would have no applicability to the creation of profit and loss statements, which could have been created and stored by electronic means for which a native format would exist.&nbsp; To the extent the argument is that the code does not require production in a native format, as set forth above, CCP section 2025.450 (c) permits a motion for an order compelling “the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”&nbsp; (emphasis added).&nbsp; These requests seek all “writings,” which fairly includes electronically stored information such as native format versions of electronically stored information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition cites to Evidence Code section 250, which states:</div><div>““Writing” means handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, photocopying, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court in this circumstance finds that the writings requested include records created in native format versions.&nbsp; Good cause has in any case been established for the production of such records based on the importance in this action of establishing when the profit and loss statements were created.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion accordingly is granted.&nbsp; The defendant is ordered to produce all responsive material in response to these requests, including electronically stored information in native format.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Documents Pertaining to Assali’s Wealth&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion concedes that the documents sought with respect to Assali’s wealth, were “not requested by Plaintiff,” but argues that during deposition, Assali was willing to produce information confirming that he had over $1.8 million in his bank account when he met plaintiff.&nbsp; As set forth above, under CCP section 2025.450(a), a party may move that a deponent “produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice…”&nbsp; Since the documents sought were not described in the deposition notice, the motion to compel the production of these documents is denied.&nbsp; The motion is denied without prejudice to plaintiff formally seeking discovery of such documents.&nbsp;

&nbsp;CCP § 2023.030(a) authorizes the imposition of monetary sanctions against a party and its attorney for misuse of the discovery process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a):&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp;

(Mediterranean Best Foods) and defendant Farmers Insurance Exchange, and that in April and May of 2019, defendant breached the agreement by making payments totaling $249,245.02 to Sona Akopian when the money was to be paid to the policy holders under the insurance agreement.&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that defendant failed to adequately verify and failed to follow its own guidelines before payment of the claim, and that as a result defendant paid the money directly to Akopian, who in turn stole the money from plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege that the policy holders/insureds, plaintiffs, never got the money owed to them from the insurance claim, and suffered damages legally caused by defendant’s breach of the agreement in the sum of $249,245.02.</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges a fraud cause of action against defendant Akopian, alleging that defendant Akopian was a representative of defendant Mediterranean Best Foods during the insurance claim process that is the subject of this litigation, but did not have authority to accept money on behalf of plaintiffs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiffs allege that defendant Akopian provided her personal banking information to accept payment that was owed to plaintiffs, accepted the money, and took it for her own personal use.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on February 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed a Request for Dismissal of the complaint without prejudice only as brought by plaintiff Meri Kirakosian.&nbsp; The dismissal was not entered as requested, the request for dismissal stating, “Plaintiff cannot dismiss other plaintiff.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The file does not reflect that the complaint as brought by Meri Kirakosian has been dismissed, so it is still pending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On April 3, 2024, on the motion of the court, pursuant to an oral request made by plaintiff, the court signed and filed an Order of Dismissal, ordering the action dismissed without prejudice as to Sona Akopian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Under CCP § 437c(p)(2) a defendant “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.&nbsp; Once the defendant... has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff... to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange seeks summary judgment of the sole cause of action brought against it for breach of contract, arguing that the cause of action is time barred under the two-year contractual limitation period to file suit included in the agreement between the parties, in effect, that there is a complete defense to the complaint against defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that if summary judgment is not granted based on the time bar it is undisputed that plaintiff authorized Akopian to act as its agent in dealing with defendant Truck Insurance Exchange on the subject claim, and clothed Akopian with at least ostensible authority to handle the claim.&nbsp; Defendant argues that plaintiffs’ own conduct accordingly precludes defendant Truck Insurance Exchange from being liable to pay the claim a second time as a matter of law.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in the moving papers explains that certain references in the documents pertinent to this matter to “Farmers,” are made because Truck Insurance Exchange (sometimes “Truck”) is one of the insurance companies that operates under the service mark “Farmers Insurance.”&nbsp; Defendant indicates that while “Farmers” and “Truck” have been used interchangeably in this case, both names refer to Truck Insurance Exchange as the company that issued the subject policy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange argues that this action is untimely under the commercial policy issued to defendant Mediterranean Best Foods, a bread/bakery business, covering defendant’s business operations during the period from January 10, 2019 to January 10, 2020, subject to stated limits, terms and exclusions (policy).&nbsp; [UMF No. 1, and evidence cited, Westergaard Decl., para. 2, Ex.

Mid-Century Ins. Co. (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 592, 605.&nbsp; The Second District in Migliore held that, “A statement that the insurer is willing to reconsider does not render a denial equivocal,” and neither does the “fact that respondent invited further input from appellant.”&nbsp; Migliore, at 605. The Second District held in the case before it, “[t]he letter states that no further benefits will be provided beyond those previously paid.&nbsp; This is unequivocal language that no further payment on the claim would be made.”&nbsp; Migliore, at 605.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The California Supreme Court has also held that once the insurer unconditionally denies liability, this is sufficient to put the insured on notice that legal action would be required to cause the recognition of the insurance claim, where “all facts essential to the statement of a cause of action are within the knowledge of the aggrieved party.”&nbsp; Neff v.

Walt Disney Pictures (2017, 2nd Dist.) 10 Cal.App.5th 56, 68-69.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs also concede that generally, parties may agree to shorten the limitations period, citing Fageol Truck &amp; Coach Co. v.

(1941) 18 Cal.2d 748, 753.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs argue that the shortening of a limitations period must be reasonable, however, in further reliance on Fageol, in which the California Supreme Court recognized that the policy before it required action to be “commenced within twelve months after the happening of the loss,” and noted:</div><div>“Such a covenant shortening the period of limitations is a valid provision of an insurance contract and cannot be ignored with impunity as long as the limitation is not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage. One year was not an unfair period of limitation. (Tebbets v. Fidelity and Casualty Co., 155 Cal. 137 [99 Pac. 501]; Beeson v.

U.S. Security Associates (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1222, for the proposition that a shorter limitations period is “reasonable” where “the shortened period nevertheless provides sufficient time to effectively pursue a judicial remedy.”&nbsp; Ellis, at 1222, citing Beeson, at 622-618.</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal in Ellis cited to Fageol as standing for the rule that “parties may agree to shorten the limitations period,” and, in considering whether a six-month shortened statute of limitations in an employment application was reasonable, provided the following framework:</div><div>“Various cases in various contexts recognize this rule, all of them emphasizing that the shortened limitation must be reasonable. As Witkin puts it, such provisions will be upheld if the shorter period is “reasonable, i.e., if it gives sufficient time for the effective pursuit of the judicial remedy.” (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Actions § 469, p. 595.) Interestingly, the author goes on, “[a]s a practical matter these [shortening] provisions are found only in contracts habitually drawn by the obligor, such as bills of lading, warehouse receipts, and insurance policies.” (Ibid.) This hardly describes Ellis's application for employment….</div><div><br></div><div>As the rule is generally described, “[a] contractually shortened limitation period, in order to be reasonable, must provide a party sufficient time to effectively pursue a judicial remedy. A contractual period of limitation is reasonable if the plaintiff has a sufficient opportunity to investigate and file an action, the time is not so short as to work a practical abrogation of the right of action, and the action is not barred before the loss or damage can be ascertained. On the other hand, a contractual limitation provision that requires the plaintiff to bring an action before any loss can be ascertained is per se unreasonable.” (51 Am.Jur.2d (2011) Limitation of Actions, § 81, p. 552, fns. omitted.)”</div><div>Ellis, at 1222-1223.</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal also observed that&nbsp;</div><div>“[M]ost reported decisions upholding shortened periods involve straightforward commercial contracts plus the unambiguous breaches or accrual of rights under those contracts.” (Moreno, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1430, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 684.)”</div><div>Ellis, at 1223.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court of appeal went on to find that the six-month period at issue in that case was not reasonable, given that where employment discrimination claims are involved, they are already subject to shortened statutes of limitations, and that because of EEOC filing requirements, and the EEOC maintaining exclusive jurisdiction over such matters during the 180 day reporting period, the effect of a six month limitations clause could “ultimately leave plaintiff without redress.”&nbsp; Ellis, at 1224.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal also observed that the legislature, in extending the one-year personal injury statute and adopting a “two-year period,” it did so, “to ensure fairness to all parties,” to “reduce litigation,” because victims “will have the opportunity to fully evaluate and use other alternatives, rather than being forced to litigate prematurely,” suggesting that a two-year statute is reasonable, as a period of two years in length, “allows a victim time for development and investigation of a case, for assessment, for evaluation—and for the possibility of settlement.”&nbsp; &nbsp;Ellis, at 1225-1226, citations omitted.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs then argue vaguely that application of the two-year limitations clause here would not provide plaintiff with sufficient opportunity to investigate and file an action with respect to the issue of the insurer having released funds to an unauthorized person.&nbsp; It is not clear what facts or circumstances are relied upon here, as it would appear that plaintiffs have had more than sufficient time to investigate and pursue their claim against the insurer in the period from September 16, 2019 through March 14, 2022.&nbsp; This result appears particularly so in light of the fact that the correspondence sent by plaintiffs’ attorney on June 13, 2019 reports that Sona Akopyan, “offered to help… in putting together the claim package to submit” to the insurer, but was “never authorized or requested to follow up on the claim, make any representations to Farmers or communicate with Farmers,” and that “It now appears that without MBF’s permission or authority she made representations to Farmers and may have diverted the insurance proceeds from Farmers.”&nbsp; [Ex. D, para. 3, p. TIE 01347].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The letter rejecting any obligation on the part of the insurer to pay out policy benefits a second time, the September 16, 2019 letter, details the involvement of Akopian in the claims process, including meeting with the insurance adjuster, reporting on the condition of the equipment after repairs, advising the insurer that plaintiff had suffered business income loss, and providing requested business records.&nbsp; [Ex. E, pp. 2-3].&nbsp; The letter details the instructions from Akopian concerning the payments to be made into what accounts.&nbsp; [Id.].&nbsp; It is clear that upon receipt of the September 16, 2019 letter, plaintiffs had more than sufficient information to prompt an investigation into the matter, determine any liability on the part of the insurer, and had more than two years in which to accomplish that and seek a judicial remedy.&nbsp; &nbsp;This situation is not a case, as in Ellis, where the accrual date is not clear, or where there are pre-filing requirements to bring a judicial action which could effectively prevent the timely pursuit of a judicial action.&nbsp; This case has a recognized straightforward insurance policy provision, with a two-year limitation sufficient to permit a claimant to investigate, evaluate, and pursue settlement prior to the time the judicial action deadline would expire.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Plaintiffs also appear to make an argument that enforcing the statute of limitations provision would not be reasonable because plaintiff did not have sufficient opportunity to investigate and file an action because the limitations clause on its face applies from the date “on which the direct physical loss or damage occurred,” and is contained under the heading of “Property Loss Conditions,” and it is not reasonable to expect plaintiff to have read the clause and presume it applied to any and all contractual disputes between the parties.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the heading, the copy of the policy submitted with the moving papers and relied upon by both parties does not include the heading, although the separate statement does, and the provision as set forth there with the heading is “Undisputed” by plaintiffs.&nbsp; [See Ex. A; UMF No. 11, Response to UMF No. 11, “Undisputed.”].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, this does not appear to be an argument that the time limitation was not “reasonable,” as the legal authorities cited focus on reasonableness of the time to investigate and bring an action, not on the reasonableness of an insured’s interpretation of the term.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, as cited above, defendant has cited legal authority under which an insured may not simply plead ignorance of a provision agreed to or argue that they did not understand what it meant.&nbsp; See Lawrence v. Western Mut. Ins. Co. (1988) 204 Cal. App.3d 565, 573.&nbsp; Moreover, the notice in this case of the time limitation was clearly served to the attorney more than two years before the time limitation ultimately expired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The argument appears to be an argument that the two-year provision does not apply here because the provision does not apply to this action, which is not an action for property loss, or physical loss or damage, and does not stem from Truck Insurance Exchange’s denial of direct physical loss or damage but from the insured’s vested interest in actually receiving their rightful payment from Truck Insurance Exchange.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This action is brought as a breach of contract action, directly alleging that the insurer’s liability is based on an alleged breach of the obligations under the policy.&nbsp; [Complaint, paras. BC-1, BC-2].&nbsp; Defendant has pointed out that under the case law, even had plaintiffs framed the issue here as other than a breach of contract claim, the limitations period agreed upon would nevertheless be properly applied to the dispute, which can override any statute.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant cites to Jang v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1291, in which the court of appeal affirmed a trial court decision granting summary judgment in favor of an insurer, based on a finding that the policy provision limiting actions for loss to one year after the loss barred the insured’s claim for bad faith, based on allegations that the manner in which the insurer had negotiated a settlement agreement to determine the appropriate insurance payments had been improper.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court of appeal reviewed the history of the case law on the issue of when a claim is subject to the statutory and agreed upon one year suit limitation, and found that the two cases permitting avoiding the policy’s statute of limitations by recasting contractual claims as claims sounding in tort had been wrongly decided, holding:</div><div>“Regardless of whether the insured elects to file a complaint alleging solely tort claims, we hold that an action seeking damages recoverable under the policy for a risk insured under the policy is merely a "transparent attempt to recover on the policy." ( Abari v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, 205 Cal. App. 3d 530, 536 (Abari) cited with approval in Prudential, supra, 51 Cal. 3d at p. 692, original italics.) As such, it is subject to the policy's statute of limitations.”</div><div>Jang, at 1301, italics in the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This action, stemming from alleged obligations under the relationship defined by the policy, is similarly an attempt to recover on that policy, and, as such, is subject to the contractual statute of limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiffs then argue that assuming arguendo that defendant can establish that the limitations clause is relevant here, plaintiffs rebut its application on the basis that the erroneous payment to Akopian constitutes noncompliance with the terms of the insurance policy.&nbsp; The argument seems to be that defendant cannot establish the condition in the limitations clause that “No one may bring a legal action against us under this insurance unless:&nbsp; a. There has been full compliance with all of the terms of this insurance.”&nbsp; Plaintiffs argue that the erroneous payment to Akopian constitutes non-compliance with the terms of the insurance policy, as Akopian was not the insured, not an agent or officer of the insured, and so any assertion by defendant that they have complied with the policy by paying money to a criminal is imprudent.&nbsp; Plaintiffs have cited no legal authority in support of this argument.&nbsp; As noted above, plaintiffs have deemed it undisputed that the insurer conducted a claims process, and paid the claims under the policy, and then conducted a second investigation concerning plaintiffs’ claim being paid a second time, concluded the investigation, and acted on that claim in denying it.&nbsp; [UMF Nos. 3-6, 8, and evidence cited, Response to UMFs Nos. 3-6, 8, “Undisputed.”].</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs have failed to raise triable issues of material fact to defeat the bar of the two-year statute in connection with the alleged breach of contract cause of action here, the only cause of action asserted against moving defendant.&nbsp; The motion for summary judgment accordingly is granted on this ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Ostensible Agency&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that if the court does not grant summary judgment based on the time bar of this action, summary judgment should be granted because Akopian was Mediterranean Best Foods, Inc.’s ostensible agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As discussed above, the court grants summary judgment on the basis that the action is time-barred.&nbsp; Hence, the court need not address the issue of whether ostensible agency can be established as a matter of law.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Motion of Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange has established by undisputed evidence that the sole cause of action brought against the moving defendant for breach of contract based on an insurance policy was untimely brought under the commercial policy issued to defendant Mediterranean Best Foods, which policy contains a provision which states:</div><div>“4.&nbsp; Legal Action Against Us&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;No one may bring a legal action against us under this insurance unless:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;a.

AT &amp; T Wireless Services (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 521, 534; quoting Koll-Irvine Center Property Owners Assn v. County of Orange 24 Cal.App.4th 1041.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that plaintiff is requesting that defendant cease construction at the Nese property because the construction plans, as submitted to the City of South Pasadena, call for construction of a structure in violation of Article 3 of the Site Planning and General Development Standards of the South Pasadena Building Code.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that Article 3, Section 36.300.030(A)(1) of the South Pasadena Building Code entitled “Setback Requirements,” states, “[a]ll structures shall comply with the with the setback requirements of the applicable zoning districts established by Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), and with any special setbacks established for specific land uses by this Zoning Code.”&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the City of South Pasadena Municipal Code further defines “structure” as used in Section 36.300.030 as “[a]nything constructed or erected, the use of which requires attachment to the ground or attachment to something located on the ground. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, the term ‘structure’ includes ‘buildings.’”&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the specification that a “structure” includes a “building,” means that the term “structure” is not limited to “buildings.”&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that Article 3, Section 36.300.030(B)(2) provides an exemption to the setback requirement for “[d]ecks, earthworks, pavement, steps, terraces, and other site design elements which are placed directly upon the finish grade and do not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding finish grade at any point.” Plaintiff argues that pursuant to this language, although earthworks may be exempt from the setback requirements, this exemption only applies if the earthworks “are placed directly upon the finish grade and do not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding finishing grade at any point.”&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the fact that the City of South Pasadena Municipal Code accounted for an exemption for certain earthworks further supports plaintiff’s position that shoring piles are a part of the “structure” subject to the setback requirements of Article 3, Section 36.300.030.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that in this case defendant has acknowledged that the shoring piles were approximately 22 feet deep by 2 feet wide, admitting that the shoring piles do not qualify for the earthworks exemption.</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also argues that this acknowledgement is also an admission that defendant has departed from the approved plans which provide for “Soldier Piles for Temporary Shoring Detail,” consisting of “2’-0 dia. x 20 ft. deep holes…”&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that despite plaintiff’s complaints regarding defendant’s violation of Article One of the Building Code, defendants refuse to cease construction, so that plaintiff has a reasonable probability of prevailing at trial, in light of defendant’s gross negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This argument does not address each element of a private nuisance cause of action, and it is not clear how plaintiff is claiming defendant has violated Civil Code section 3429, or how plaintiff claims that defendant has engaged in an interference which is “substantial and unreasonable.”</div><div><br></div><div>More fundamentally, the argument that defendant has engaged in alleged violations based on specific provisions of the City of South Pasadena Building Code is difficult to follow or analyze because plaintiff has failed to submit with the moving papers the pertinent section or articles of the various building and zoning provisions upon which plaintiff relies, and from which he repeatedly quotes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes that while the Declaration of Gary Cavafian submitted with the moving papers makes reference to Exhibit 1 as a copy of the pertinent Article from the South Pasadena Municipal Code, and to correspondence attached as Exhibits 2, 3, and 4, there were in fact no exhibits submitted with the moving papers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court may accordingly find that plaintiff has failed to meet any burden on this motion by failure to submit to the court the provisions on which he relies to establish a reasonable probability of establishing there was any provable violation or wrongful conduct to support his nuisance cause of action.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes, however, that the opposition does not object on this ground, but also quotes from the South Pasadena Municipal Code.&nbsp; [Opposition para. 11].&nbsp; The opposition papers also do not submit a copy of the pertinent requirements or language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court does not consider it the court’s responsibility to track down the Building Code and Municipal Code requirements which plaintiff claims were violated.&nbsp; However, the court also notes that during previous ex parte proceedings, it came to the court’s attention that some portion of the South Pasadena Municipal Code was attached to the previously filed Declaration of Gary Cavafin [sic] in support of his ex parte application as Exhibit 1, and a further “excerpt” of the pertinent provisions were attached to the correspondence sent to the Building Division of City of South Pasadena on April 5, 2024, and attached to the ex parte declaration as Exhibit 3, at pp. 3-6.&nbsp; The court accordingly considers those documents in connection with this motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court notes that for purposes of the court’s analysis even the provisions attached to the ex parte declaration do not appear to be complete copies of the Building or Zoning provisions which could be pertinent here.&nbsp; For example, the provisions included as Exhibit 1 to the ex parte declaration entitled South Pasadena Municipal Code—Chapter 36, Zoning Code, lists the sections of that chapter, but includes only the first three sections of eleven sections, and is dated September of 2002.&nbsp; [See Ex Parte Carafian Decl., Ex. 1].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The “Excerpt” from the South Pasadena Site Planning and General Development Standards attached to the ex parte declaration as Exhibit 3, does not on its face identify it as such a document, starts in mid-sentence, states at its heading that it is part of “Article 3,” with no section number designated, and evidently consists of only pages 7 through 10 of 159 pages.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This presentation does not provide the court with much confidence that the court has been provided all of the provisions which potentially impact the question before it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The parties appear to agree that the Setback requirements are subject to South Pasadena Municipal Code—Chapter 36, Zoning Code, General Property Development and Use Standards section 36.300.030 (A)(1), which provides:</span></div><div>“A. Setback requirements.</div><div>1. All structures shall comply with the setback requirements of the applicable zoning districts established by Article 2 (Zoning Districts and Allowable Land Uses), and with any special setbacks established for specific land uses by this Zoning Code.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Ex Parte Decl., Ex. 1, section 36.300.030 (A)(1)].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>No one has bothered to provide the court with a copy of Article 2 to confirm that there has or has not been compliance with that Article.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There appears to be no dispute that the provision applies to all “structures.”&nbsp; There also does not appear to be a dispute that the allowable setback is no closer than 30 inches to a lot line.&nbsp; It is not clear from what provision the parties have drawn this conclusion, but the excerpt in Exhibit 3 includes a table of Allowed Projections Into Setbacks, which, as applied to sills, cornices, roof overhang or eaves, states that the allowed projection is “No closer than 30 in. to a lot line, provided that the lowest edge of the feature is at least 8 feet above ground level.”&nbsp; [Ex. 3, p. 4 of 11, pp. 8/159, Table 3-1].&nbsp; It is not clear to the court if this is actually the applicable section.&nbsp; No citations to evidence are provided by the parties.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There also appears to be no dispute that the pilings, the construction of which have been approved by the City, are located closer than 30 inches to the property line of defendant.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Assuming the 30-inch figure is applicable, the question remains whether the reference to “structures” being required to comply with setback requirements would include the shoring holes into which slurry has been poured on this project.&nbsp; The plans on the grading plan refers to shoring piles, which are to be drilled, with a steel column inserted, and then leveled.&nbsp; [Laub Decl., Exs. A, B, “Detail, Soldier Piles for Temporary Shoring Detail.”].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Defendant submits the declaration of Stephen Laub, a principal of STL Consulting, Inc., which renders consulting services to defendant concerning the project on the Nese property, who explains that the plans for the construction, including the shoring pilings and their placement, has been approved by the City:</div><div>“3. A soils company was employed to test and report regarding the soils conditions of the property. That work was performed and a soils report issued by Geo Concepts. The soils report was then provided to the structural engineer for evaluation and recommendations regarding construction. For this project, the structural engineer required shoring. The plans were drafted and submitted to the city. The city reviewed the plans as well as the soils report and approved the plans. A true and correct copy of the approved plans is attached hereto as Exhibit "A". For the courts convenience attached hereto as Exhibit "B" is the page of the plans which shows the property line in green, the shoring holes in red, and the outline of the proposed structure in blue.&nbsp;</div><div>4. …. All of the shoring holes are within the property owned by John F. Nese…. The structure is four feet from the property line.&nbsp;</div><div>5. We received approval by the structural engineer to pour slurry instead of the days schedule to pour structural concrete around set I beams.&nbsp;</div><div>6. On March 29, 2024 we started the pour. This is a slurry pour to fill the holes. I was supervising the work on the property on that day as well as the soils inspector.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>[Laub Decl., paras. 3-6].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Laub declaration describes a confrontation with plaintiff while the pour was proceeding, and plaintiff’s disruption of the construction, and the resolution of removing one particular worker from the project, and also indicates that despite plaintiff’s protests, there has been no withdrawal of approval or action to the contrary of continued approval by the City:</span></div><div>“9. The city inspector was also out to the property on that day. The inspector asked for a copy of all of the paperwork to be in his office the following Monday. I provided him with all of the documents including the plans, the soils report, the permits shoring deputy inspector report and the pour log.&nbsp;</div><div>10. We have not received a stop notice or anything to indicate that there are any problems with the construction.</div><div>[Laub Decl., paras. 7-10].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that the shoring pilings are “structures” subject to the set back requirement, with no exception applying.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, plaintiff argues that the City of South Pasadena Municipal Code further defines “structure” as used in Section 36.300.030 as “[a]nything constructed or erected, the use of which requires attachment to the ground or attachment to something located on the ground. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, the term ‘structure’ includes ‘buildings.’”&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that the specification that a “structure” includes a “building,” means that the term “structure” is not limited to “buildings.”&nbsp; [Motion, p. 6:20-25]. This quoted language is not followed by a citation to evidence or to a code section and does not seem to appear in any of the code sections submitted to the court.&nbsp; No code sections are submitted with the reply papers.&nbsp; Although not obligated to do so, the court has reviewed the papers submitted on this matter, including those submitted on the ex parte application, and cannot find this language.&nbsp; The language suggests it is included somewhere other than Section 36.300.030 itself, and perhaps even other than in Article 3.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, even if the language exists, the court is not persuaded that the shoring pilings could reasonably be determined to constitute “structures,” or things “constructed or erected” in these circumstances.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The shoring pilings do not appear to constitute things constructed or built up or produced, nor erected, as those terms are ordinarily construed, and the term “structures” was evidently construed by the City in approving the plans, and in evidently requiring the shoring pilings based on the soils report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the only thing which could be considered a “structure” with respect to this project would be the residential building, which, as set forth in the plans and approved by the City, is “four feet from the property line,” well beyond the 30 inches required here.&nbsp; [Laub Decl., para. 4].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, plaintiff’s moving papers point out that the language which has been submitted by plaintiff includes an express exemption which appears to apply here.&nbsp; Specifically, Article 3, Section 36.300.030(B)(2) provides:</div><div>“B. Exemptions from setback requirements. The minimum</div><div>setback. requirements of this Zoning Code apply to all uses except the following:…</div><div>2. Decks, earthworks, pavement, steps, terraces, and other site design elements which are placed directly upon the finish grade and do not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding finish grade at any point.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Ex Parte Decl., Ex. 1, Section 36.300.030(B)(2)].</div><div><br></div><div>This language would appear to directly apply to the “earthworks” here, or “other site design elements,” as it appears that the shoring pilings, which are directed to be leveled, and do not appear to have any height at all, would qualify under this exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff argues that the fact that the City of South Pasadena Municipal Code accounted for an exemption for certain earthworks further supports plaintiff’s position that shoring piles are a part of the “structure” subject to the setback requirements of Article 3, Section 36.300.030.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that in this case defendant has acknowledged that the shoring piles were approximately 22 feet deep by 2 feet wide, admitting that the shoring piles do not qualify for the earthworks exemption.&nbsp; This argument makes no sense, as plaintiff depends on the depth of the shoring pilings, not their height or relationship to the finished grade. Even if the shoring pilings were considered structures by the City, the City could have also reasonably determined that they were subject to this express exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Finally, although not argued by the parties, an interpretation that the shoring pilings are structures, subject to the standard set back would not further the stated reason for the zoning provisions, as set forth in the first provision of Section 36.300.030 itself:</div><div>“Setback Measurement and Exceptions:</div><div>&nbsp;This Section provides standards for the use and minimum size of required setbacks. These standards are intended to provide open areas around structures for: visibility and traffic safety; access to and around structures; access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight; separation of incompatible land uses; and space for privacy, landscaping, and recreation.”&nbsp;</div><div>[Ex Parte Decl., Ex. 1, section 36.300.030].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, the shoring piles are to be leveled, and would not implicate visibility, traffic safety, access to structures, access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight on the part of anyone, and plaintiff has not established how he would directly suffer any impact from the shoring pilings.&nbsp; Plaintiff has not established by admissible evidence any incompatible land uses, or an impact on his privacy, landscaping or recreation.&nbsp; The purposes suggest that the standards apply to structures above the ground, not components of a construction project such as the instant shoring pilings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Overall, the court’s interpretation that the shoring pilings would not constitute structures at all, subject to any set back, or fall within the express exception in the Code, appears to be in alignment with the interpretation by the City of its own set-back requirements, which interpretation should be entitled to deference.&nbsp; Plaintiff accordingly has failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits in this action.&nbsp; &nbsp;In such a case, a preliminary injunction cannot be granted.&nbsp; As explained in Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 303-304:</span></div><div>“It is well established that we may only review the trial court's order granting a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.

&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, based on this showing, plaintiff has failed to sufficiently establish expertise, training or education “on the subject matter to which his testimony relates.&nbsp; The court would not, based on the declaration submitted deem plaintiff an expert entitled to state a professional opinion concerning geology, soil issues, fire hazards, or the geological effects on plaintiff’s property of the construction occurring solely on defendant’s property.&nbsp; It is of note that the construction project has been approved by the City, based on a soils report issued by a soils company which was reviewed by the City before the City approved the plans. [Laub Decl., para. 3].&nbsp; Plaintiff is not a geologist or a soils expert, or a fire expert, which are all very different from being a licensed civil engineer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court also notes that plaintiff has demonstrated no geological expertise and has had weeks since the original ex parte hearing to obtain a geological or soils expert and has failed to do so.&nbsp; In addition, no studies, documentation, soils report or other materials are referred to which would support plaintiff’s opinion.&nbsp; The subject opinion testimony accordingly is disregarded by the court.

The e-Pack cards are purchased digitally and are accessible in digital format to the buyer. Additionally, for each digital card purchased, defendant Upper Deck maintains an actual physical card which is kept by Upper Deck. At any time, the purchaser of a digital card may ask Upper Deck to</span></div><div>mail them the original physical card.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that through approximately May of 2024, Pivot had acquired at least $5 million worth of Marvel trading cards (subject Marvel trading cards), which were kept by Pivot in a secure location.&nbsp; Pivot alleges that Pivot is physically located in the City of Los Angeles, and that also located at the same physical property is the business Jadeite Management LLC (Jadiete).&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that from approximately May of 2022 through August of 2023, Jadiete employed defendant Akika Rosenbluth as an intern.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that on or about August 5, 2024, plaintiff discovered that after Mr. Rosenbluth’s internship ended, and perhaps subsequently, Mr. Rosenbluth stole approximately $750,000 worth of Marvel trading cards from the secure location where the cards were being stored, including both cards in physical forms and e-Pack cards.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Rosenbluth, through his internship, acquired access to plaintiff’s online Upper Deck account, through which he was able to sell plaintiff’s subject Marvel trading cards to buyers, which he did without plaintiff’s authorization, consent, knowledge, or awareness.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that some if not most of the e-Packs belonging to Pivot, which were stolen and then sold by Mr. Rosenbluth, have since been redeemed by the buyers for their physical copies through Upper Deck.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that once the physical copies of the cards are sent out to those who purchased e-Packs from Mr. Rosenbluth, the physical copies are impossible for Pivot to track down with the hope of recovering them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges a cause of action for conversion against defendant Rosenbluth, and a cause of action for declaratory relief, with request for temporary, preliminary and permanent relief against defendant Upper Deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on August 27, 2024, the court heard an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order brought by plaintiff Pivot.&nbsp; The application was granted in part.&nbsp; The court ordered that as of the date of the order, August 27, 2024, Upper Deck could not permit anyone other than Pivot to redeem an e-Pack product currently held on Pivot’s e-Pack account for a physical copy of the card.&nbsp; A list of the 499 cards at issue is attached to the order.&nbsp; &nbsp;The court also ordered that Upper Deck has no obligation to trace or otherwise take action with respect to the 2,350 cards that have been moved out of Pivot’s e-pack account to third parties by defendant Rosenbluth.&nbsp; The court further set the hearing on the preliminary injunction for September 13, 2024, and set a briefing schedule.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Plaintiff Pivot seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant Upper Deck, its agents, servants, and assigns, from distributing, sending, selling, transferring or otherwise disseminating any physical copies of Upper Deck Marvel trading cards in Upper Deck’s possession which correspond to digital e-Pack cards owned by Pivot to anyone other than Pivot.&nbsp; Plaintiff submits a complete detailed list of the subject Marvel trading cards, attached as Exhibit 1 to a Declaration of Avi Oscherowitz, manager of Pivot, who states that the list includes all Marvel e-Pack cards belonging to Pivot which were stolen by Rosenbluth of which Oscherwitz is currently aware.&nbsp; [Oscherwitz Decl., para. 13, Ex. 1].&nbsp; This list appears to be a substantially longer list than the list attached to the order granting in part the TRO, consisting of over 40 pages, with approximately 50 entries per page, which the court assumes is the 2,350 cards mentioned in the Temporary Restraining Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff seeks relief under CCP § 526, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) An injunction may be granted in the following cases:&nbsp;</div><div>(1) When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually.</div><div>(2) “When it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable injury, to a party to the action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>(3) When it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.</div><div>(4) When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief.</div><div>(5) Where it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation which would afford adequate relief.”</div><div><br></div><div>An application for a preliminary injunction is considered a motion procedure and must be supported by affidavits or declarations which provide evidentiary facts under CCP section 2009.&nbsp;

See also Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 149-150.&nbsp; The burden is on the party seeking injunctive relief “to show all elements necessary to support issuance of a preliminary injunction.” O’Connell v.

State of California, (1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, the California Supreme Court set the following criteria in connection with preliminary injunction applications under subdivision (a) (1):</div><div>“In deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a court must weigh two ‘interrelated’ factors: (1) the likelihood that the moving party will ultimately prevail on the merits and (2) the relative interim harm to the parties from issuance or nonissuance of the injunction.”</div><div>Butt, at 677-678.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The preliminary injunction is sought only as to defendant Upper Deck, and a noted above, the complaint in this matter alleges a single cause of action against this defendant for “Declaratory Relief, with Request for Temporary, Preliminary, and Permanent Injunctive Relief.”&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, Complaint, p. 5].&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 1060 provides with respect to declaratory relief:</div><div>“Any person interested under a written instrument, excluding a will or a trust, or under a contract, or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another, or in respect to, in, over or upon property,... may, in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of his her rights and duties in the premises, including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or contract.&nbsp; &nbsp;He or she may ask for a declaration of rights or duties, either alone or with other relief; and the court may make a binding declaration of these rights or duties, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed at the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect, and the declaration shall have the force of a final judgment.&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration may be had before there has been any breach of the obligation in respect to which said declaration is sought.”</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff argues that it can establish each element of the declaratory relief cause of action as plaintiff is seeking a declaration of its rights to its property: the subject stolen physical cards; is seeking a declaration with respect to Upper Deck which is still in possession of a portion of the physical cards which correspond to the stolen e-Pack cards; and a controversy exists as Pivot has made a demand to Upper Deck to prevent any further dissemination of the physical cards rightfully owned by Pivot, which Upper Deck has refused to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff cites as support for this argument the declaration of Pivot’s attorney, Elan N.

We therefore ask that you ensure that none of the stolen cards (detailed in Exhibit 1 to Pivot’s Complaint), including e-Pack cards, be further distributed, sold, transferred, or other [sic] disseminated to anyone other than Pivot.”</div><div>[Stone Decl., Ex. 1].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The declaration does not indicate that Upper Deck has refused this demand.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, defendant Upper Deck in opposition argues that plaintiff Pivot has failed to meet its burden of showing a viable legal theory against Upper Deck under which it is likely to succeed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argues that at the TRO hearing, the court specifically asked Pivot to present its legal theory against Upper Deck and explain why it will prevail under that theory, but Pivot in the moving papers does not identify any right by Pivot to have the cards returned nor any obligation by Upper Deck to help Pivot accomplish this.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant relies on Otay Land Co. v. Royal Indemnity Co. (2008) 169 Cal.

City of Los Angeles (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 376, 399, in which the Second District observed, “a cause of action must exist before injunctive relief may be granted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that rather than address the legal theory and specific rights and duties entitling Pivot to the return of the physical versions of the stolen e-Pack cards and why Pivot is likely to prevail, Pivot merely states the elements of a declaratory relief cause of action, and only goes so far as demonstrating there may be a controversy about its claim, but does not explain why Pivot will prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff does not explain its legal theory or what rights or duties the parties have with respect to each other under California law.&nbsp; It is not clear what Upper Deck is alleged to have done wrong, when it appears to have had no fault in the transactions facilitated by Rosenbluth with Pivot’s credentials.&nbsp; This presentation appears wholly insufficient to establish any probability of plaintiff prevailing on its claim on the merits in this context.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in the moving papers also briefly argues that Pivot is likely to prevail on its conversion cause of action “against Mr. Rosenbluth,” and sets forth the elements and facts supporting a conversion claim against defendant Rosenbluth.&nbsp; However, the conversion cause of action is not alleged against defendant Upper Deck, and plaintiff here seeks injunctive relief against defendant Upper Deck only, not against defendant Rosenbluth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in an easily missed footnote in the moving papers seems to suggest that Upper Deck may be responsible for conversion.&nbsp; [See Order to Show Cause, p. 11, n.1].&nbsp; This argument is also easily missed because the complaint does not allege the conversion cause of action against Upper Deck.&nbsp; Plaintiff then in the reply seems to more directly argue that Upper Deck can be responsible for conversion, arguing that Upper Deck has a duty under the law to return Pivot’s stolen property and may be found liable for conversion for failing to do so.&nbsp; It is troubling that this argument is only clearly raised for the first time in the reply papers, so that defendant has not had the opportunity to respond.&nbsp; It is also unclear why, if plaintiff believes in good faith, it can support such a claim against Upper Deck, plaintiff has not sought promptly to amend its complaint.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in the footnote and reply cites, without discussion, Plummer v. Day/Eisenberg, LLP (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 38, with a nonexistent pinpoint cite, in which the court of appeal recognized that a conversion action could be based on a contractual agreement in a retention agreement for an attorney’s lien.&nbsp; It is not explained on what basis a conversion action could be maintained here, under contract, tort, or some other theory.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also argues in opposition that under California law, where a plaintiff has vested another with apparent authority to act on its behalf and that individual does so but exceeds his authority, down-stream innocent purchasers for value have stronger rights to the products than the plaintiff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant argues that this is the case here, where defendant Rosenbluth, a former employee/intern, had access to Pivot’s e-Pack account and allegedly exceeded his authority by converting cards to his own use.&nbsp; Defendant argues that among the two innocent parties, Pivot and the third-party purchasers, Pivot must suffer the loss.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant relies on Civil Code section 3543, which provides:</span></div><div>“Where one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant cites authority under which where negligence or other misconduct is established and contributed to a loss, an innocent purchaser taking a void instrument can find protection under Section 3543 and the doctrine of estoppel. Crittenden v. McCloud (1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 42, 50; see also Wutzke v. Bill Reid Painting Service, Inc. (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 36, 44 (“It is settled that the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be invoked by an innocent purchaser, in spite of the fact that ordinarily a forged instrument cannot carry title. The owner of property cannot be divested thereof by a forged instrument, but his conduct ... may estop him from denying its validity.”(citations, quotations omitted)).</div><div><br></div><div>As defendant argues, misplaced confidence is one way to establish negligence under Civil Code section 3543. See, e.g., Reusche v. California Pacific Title Ins. Co. (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 731, 738 (“Misplaced confidence has been held to be negligence within section 3543 and has resulted in the estoppel of a true owner from asserting title against an innocent party.”), citing Asp v. Lowry (1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 81, 85:</div><div>“Where a reasonable person would be led to believe … that she was the owner of the property, and where the innocent third party parts with value in reliance thereon, the third party should be protected where the true owner is guilty of misplaced confidence amounting to negligence. Misplaced confidence may be held to be negligence within the meaning of the maxim set forth in section 3543 of the Civil Code, that where one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer. This is particularly so where the true owner is estopped to assert its title against the innocent third party.”</div><div>Asp, at 85.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant relies on J. G. Boswell Co. v. W. D. Felder &amp; Co. (1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 767, 774, in which the court of appeal affirmed a judgment based on a jury verdict in favor of defendants on a conversion claim, where 29 bales of cotton were improperly transferred by a shipping clerk of plaintiff, a corporation in the business of buying, selling and shipping cotton, to a third party, and plaintiff later discovered that multiple bales of cotton were missing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The court of appeal found that Civil Code section 3543 and the misplaced confidence rule could be applied even where a principal has not authorized the agent’s act:</div><div>“The evidence shows that the plaintiff placed defendant Stuart in a position to commit the alleged conversion of the cotton here involved. Stuart was at all times the shipping clerk of plaintiff, had access to all the records, was permitted to sell cotton from plaintiff's yard and to retain for his own use loose cotton which he was permitted to sell in the usual channels of the cotton trade. Where, as here, an owner clothes another with the apparent title to or power of disposition over property, and an innocent third party has thereby been induced to deal with the apparent owner in reference thereto, the true owner is estopped from afterward asserting his title. (24 Cal.Jur., p. 1029.)</div><div><br></div><div>As was said in Phelps v. American Mortgage Co., 40 Cal.App.2d 361, 366 [104 P.2d 880]:</div><div>“... where an owner deposits his property with another and gives the depository such indicia of ownership that a reasonable man dealing with such agent is reasonably led to believe the agent is the owner of such property and parts with value in reliance thereon, the third person will be protected even though the true owner is guilty of no more than misplaced confidence.”</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, the defendants are protected by the rule set forth in section 3543 of the Civil Code: “Where one of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, by whose negligence it happened, must be the sufferer.” This rule has been applied to bona fide purchasers for value from those who have been clothed with the indicia of ownership. (Meadows v. Hampton Live Stock Com. Co., 55 Cal.App.2d 634, 636 [131 P.2d 591].) And in Brown v. Oxtoby, 45 Cal.App.2d 702, 708 [114 P.2d 622], it is said:</div><div><br></div><div>“Although the principal may not have actually authorized the particular fraudulent act, yet the principal is responsible for the fraud of the agent if he has entrusted to the agent a matter which puts the agent in a position to perpetrate the fraud complained of, while the agent is executing the agency transaction within the scope of his employment.”&nbsp;</div><div>J.

All the relevant logins for Mazelcards1 over this period were “auto” meaning that the devices used to trade away the allegedly converted cards were devices that had previously logged into the Mazelcards1 account.</div><div><br></div><div>9. Assuming that Defendant Rosenblum was the person logging into the account between December 30, 2023, and March 2, 2024, he was using devices with log-in credentials saved on the device.”</div><div>[Swiderski Decl., paras. 8, 9].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that this is a situation where Pivot put Rosenblum in a position to perpetuate the e-Pack transactions which it now seeks to unwind and claw back from third parties who have no reason to believe the transactions were illegitimate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This argument supports, at the very least, a probability that plaintiff would not succeed in any attempt to place responsibility for the loss on defendant Upper Deck, rather than on itself, or Rosenbluth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff does not directly address the argument asserted by defendant that as between plaintiff and the innocent purchaser third parties who now claim ownership of the e-cards, and entitlement to physical cards on demand, the third parties would have the superior claim to ownership of the property.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In any case, the court finds that on the showing before it, plaintiff has&nbsp;</span></div><div>failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits in this action.&nbsp; &nbsp;In such a case, a preliminary injunction cannot be granted.&nbsp; As explained in Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 303-304:</div><div>“It is well established that we may only review the trial court's order granting a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. ( Butt v. State of California (1992) 4 Cal. 4th 668, 678 [15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240]; accord, Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 432, 447 [261 Cal. Rptr. 574, 777 P.2d 610] (Common Cause).) The trial court abuses its discretion in granting such a preliminary injunction when "there is no likelihood" that the movants will prevail on the merits of their claims&nbsp; for relief. (Ibid.) "A preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief." (Ibid.)”</div><div>Doe, at 303-304.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The motion is denied on the ground plaintiff has failed to establish any likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiff’s vague declaratory relief claim against Upper Deck.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In addition, it does not appear that plaintiff has sufficiently established that a preliminary injunction is necessary here because Pivot will suffer irreparable harm should injunctive relief not be provided.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that this includes the permanent loss of unique, valuable, and irreplaceable property for which monetary damages will not suffice.&nbsp; As noted above, plaintiff’s manager, Oscherowitz, describes the stolen trading cards as “extremely unique and extremely limited in production,” and “irreplaceable,” with a “future value” which is “not readily ascertainable.”&nbsp; &nbsp;[Oscherwitz Decl., paras. 11, 12].</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This argument is not persuasive, as Pivot can seek monetary damages from defendant Rosenbluth, which is an effective remedy in this matter.&nbsp; The complaint expressly alleges that “Mr. Rosenbluth stole approximately $750,000 worth of Marvel Trading Cards.”&nbsp; [RFJN, Ex. 1, Complaint, para. 18].&nbsp; &nbsp;It is difficult to believe that any future value of a collectible in a competitive market could not be effectively calculated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>As pointed out in the opposition, the existence of another effective judicial remedy, such as monetary damages, is grounds for denying a request for injunctive relief, as the party to whom that remedy is available has not suffered irreparable harm.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant cites to Simms v. NPCK Enterprises, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 233, 243, in which the court of appeal found that the trial court had erred in granting an injunction, since the claim and delivery law and a writ of possession thereunder provided a complete prejudgment remedy to recover possession of personal property. The court of appeal held, “The existence of another effective judicial remedy is grounds for denying injunctive relief.”&nbsp; Simms, at 243.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Here, plaintiff’s alleged loss can be compensated for in monetary damages. The preliminary injunction is denied on this ground as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Finally, with respect to balancing the hardship to be faced by plaintiff if the injunction is not issued against the hardship to defendant if the injunction is issued, plaintiff argues that now that the e-Pack cards have been stolen and sold to others, anyone, including Rosenbluth and the buyers of the stolen cards, may easily request Upper Deck to sent them the physical copies, which is clearly irreparably harming plaintiff.&nbsp; [Oscherowitz Decl., paras. 9-12].&nbsp; Plaintiff again argues that the cards are unique, so that plaintiff will be harmed without any recourse and the permanent loss of unique and irreplaceable property.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues that Upper Deck knew when it entered into the digital card business that theft was inevitable and it would have to deal with issues such as this one as part of the regular course of its business, and that Upper Deck has a duty under the law to ensure that Pivot’s stolen property cannot be further disseminated.&nbsp; Plaintiff has cited no evidence supporting this description of the digital card business and its risks, and no legal authority imposing a duty under the law on Upper Deck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court is cognizant of the fact that plaintiff is seeking by this motion action affecting multiple separate trades, as the list at Exhibit 1 is well over 40 pages long, with approximately 50 entries per page, and plaintiff had previously argued that the list of effected transactions was 2,350, a significant number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant in opposition argues that plaintiff’s harms can be addressed by a money damages award against the perpetrator of the theft, Rosenbluth, and that the relative balancing favors Upper Deck as well, which is being asked to be prevented from disseminating the physical cards in its possession corresponding to those owned by Pivot, and to effectively take hundreds of assets from its users.&nbsp; &nbsp;Defendant indicates that, although Defendant has no fault in this matter, it would be required to go through an involved process to identify the accounts and locate and remove the cards at issue.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The Declaration of Benjamin Swiderski, Vice President of E-Commerc at Upper Deck, and manager and overseer of its e-Pack platform, explains that there would be a process to identify all trades involved, filter and confirm, and that only after that is finished, Upper Deck could then query its database, in a process requiring an additional 20 hours or five days of developer time:</span></div><div>4. I understand that Plaintiff alleges that an intern or employee of the company traded cards from the Mazelcards1 e-pack account to third parties for compensation which he took for himself. To attempt to identify where those e-pack cards currently reside on Upper Deck’s e-pack platform (if anywhere), Upper Deck would need to take the following steps:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>a.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Identify all trades involving the Mazelcards1 account that include the products that were allegedly stolen from their account based on the date range identified in the Complaint (12/30/23 – 3/2/24). This would be all trades where Mazelcards1 was the trade initiator or counterparty.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>b. For all identified trades, determine the counterparty to the trade and the e-pack items involved.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>c. Filter out any e-pack cards that re-entered the Mazelcards1 account.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>d. Confirm with the owner of the Mazelcards1 account that the remaining list contains the impacted e-pack products.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>e. With a confirmed list of cards at issue, Upper Deck can query its database using the unique identifier for each e-pack card. This will show the current location of the card if it remains on the e-pack platform. Upper Deck cannot take any action with respect to cards moved off the platform.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>f. Make a record of the location for each e-pack card remaining on the platform to ensure that there is record of where the card may need to be returned. Upper Deck would also create a report containing all items, locations, and emails associated with the accounts currently holding the items. This will be used for contacting these users in the instance where the items are removed from their collections.</div><div><br></div><div>g. We would set up a neutral holding e-pack account to place the located cards into.</div><div><br></div><div>h. For the cards to be held in the neutral account, we would have to update the item database, specifically, updating the ownership data of the identified items. This will remove the items from the accounts in which they currently reside and move them to the neutral account.</div><div><br></div><div>5. Our team has looked into the time the above process would take. Once we have a confirmed list of impacted cards (i.e. once we complete step 4(d) above), it will take at least 20 hours of developer work which would take a minimum of 5 days given developer’s other necessary commitments.”</div><div>[Swiderski Decl., paras. 4, 5].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant also argues that its burden, if the injunction were granted would also include defendant having to contact users in current possession of the cards.&nbsp; These users paid real consideration for the cards by paying money or trading cards of their own and would be rightly concerned about their property being removed from their account.&nbsp; In that situation, Upper Deck would be required to respond to, and to resolve, each of the concerns.&nbsp; Such a result would cause Upper Deck to suffer a tremendous reputational hit from clawing back cards from users who acquired the cards in good faith.&nbsp; The Swiderski Declaration indicates:</span></div><div>“6. If ordered to claw back the potentially stolen e-pack cards remaining on the e-pack platform, Upper Deck will also have to expend numerous hours discussing the issue with its customers who will lose access to cards in their e-pack accounts and naturally be frustrated and disappointed by the development. I expect this will hurt the e-pack brand and reputation which aims to provide a secure and final trading process to the users. If users suspect that the platform is compromised or that their trades might be unwound causing them to lose value and access to the physical versions of the cards they acquired, that is highly detrimental to the platform and the brand we have worked hard to build around it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>7. The trading card and collectibles industry is a small and close nit [sic] one. Word of Upper Deck’s removal of products from customer accounts is very likely to be discussed in relevant online and offline forums by Upper Deck’s current and potential customers. This, too, will negatively impact the brand and future value of the platform. Upper Deck’s goal is to have customers trust it to hold the digital and physical versions of their cards securely in a manner that allows them to take possession of the cards whenever they so choose.”</div><div>i.e. Upper Deck [Swiderski Decl., paras. 6, 7].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>This burden of effort and expense, and significant business risk, proposed to be imposed on a party, who bears no responsibility for the original loss of the subject Marvel trading cards, is substantial.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span> In weighing the relative harms here, the balance of hardships clearly favors defendant, and no preliminary injunction is issued on this ground as well.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>RULING:&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Plaintiff Pivot Collectibles LLC’s Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue is DENIED.
