</div><div>Case No: 	23 GDCV00207			Trial Date:	February 24, 2025 
</div><div>Case Name:	Stovell, et al. v. KIA America, Inc.
</div><div>MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION
</div><div>Moving Party: 	Defendant Kia America, Inc.     
</div><div>Responding Party:	Plaintiffs Davin Lamont Stovell and Roshaun Carlise Stovell  
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;(No Opposition)      
</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:
</div><div>Order compelling Plaintiffs to attend and testify and deposition and produce documents.
</div><div>MONETARY SANCTION:
</div><div>None sought 
</div><div>DECLARATION SUPPORTING MOTION:
</div><div>Reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally: 	Yes, Ex. D 
</div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
</div><div>Plaintiffs Davin Lamont Stovell and Roshaun Carlise Stovell allege that in July of 2020, plaintiffs purchased a 2021 Kia Telluride, with an accompanying written warranty from defendant Kia America Inc., pursuant to which Kia America, Inc. agreed to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance. 
</div><div>Plaintiffs allege that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiffs with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty, and developed other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty, including the vehicle’s structural, electrical, engine and emission system defects.   
</div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that the defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the express warranty period, and substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.  Plaintiffs delivered the vehicle to manufacturer’s authorized repair facility for repair of the nonconformities, and defendant has been unable to conform plaintiff’s vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of repair attempts.  The complaint alleges that notwithstanding plaintiffs’ entitlement, defendant has failed to either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or to promptly make restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.  
</div><div>The complaint alleges three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, and Civil Code section 1793.2. 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. seeks by this motion to compel plaintiffs to attend and testify at depositions and to produce documents.   
</div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:
</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, …the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony…”
</div><div>The moving papers establish here that plaintiffs were served with a deposition notice on February 28, 2023, for a deposition to take place on May 4, 2023. [Maxwell Decl., para. 2, Ex. A].  On April 20, 2023, plaintiffs served objections to the notice based on unavailability and unilateral notice.  [Maxwell Decl., para. 3; Exs. B, C]. 
</div><div>Since then, in response to plaintiffs’ objections, defendant has emailed counsel for plaintiffs requesting dates for plaintiffs’ depositions, on April 20, 2023, May 26, 2023, August 11, 2023, September 19, 2023, and November 29, 2023, but no response has been provided.  [Maxwell Decl., paras. 4-9; Ex. D].  As of the date of the filing of the motion, on January 16, 2024, plaintiffs have not responded to defendant’s numerous attempts to obtain alternate deposition dates.  [Maxwell Decl., para. 9].  
</div><div>This showing is sufficient to establish that plaintiffs, parties to the action, have failed to appear for deposition. There is no timely opposition to this motion, so plaintiffs have not met plaintiffs’ burden of establishing that any of plaintiffs’ objections are valid.  Also, any objections concerning unavailability are no longer valid in light of plaintiffs’ failure to provide available dates for well over a year. The court orders the depositions to proceed on a date certain.
</div><div>The motion also seeks that the court order the deponents to provide document production along with the deposition testimony. 
</div><div>&nbsp;Under CCP § 2025.450 (b):
</div><div>“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
</div><div>(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
</div><div>(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The documents requested appear related to the claims being made by plaintiffs in this action, including, for example, documents concerning the purchase of the vehicle, and those reflecting repairs, maintenance, estimates or other service or maintenance work performed on the vehicle.  There appears to be good cause for the production of documents at deposition.  As discussed above, defendant has made numerous attempts to meet and confer concerning the deposition notice.  Again, plaintiffs have failed to file timely opposition to this motion, so have failed to meet their burden to justify objections.  The motion accordingly is granted.  The deposition and production of documents also is ordered as requested.  
</div><div>&nbsp;The parties are reminded that this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation, now posted and available on the Los Angeles Superior Court website in connection with this Department, Glendale Courthouse, Department D.   The Order was signed and entered by the Court on January 24, 2023, and was revised, signed and entered on January 11, 2024
</div><div>Pursuant to that Order, “any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the Court.”
</div><div>[Order section (1)(a)]. 
</div><div>The Order sets forth the following provisions concerning discovery in Song-Beverly matters which appear to address the discovery disputes raised by the current motion. With respect to depositions, the Order provides:
</div><div>4.	Deposition:  Within the time limits allowed by law.  Defendant may depose plaintiff, and plaintiff may depose the person most knowledgeable (PMK) as to up to 5 categories of information, plus a deposition of the PMK as to why the subject vehicle was not repurchased, in addition to depositions of any experts identified by the parties, after a formal demand and exchange of expert witness information, per CCP § 2034.  Parties shall meet and confer as to whether there is a need to take any additional depositions.  Any additional depositions may only be noticed and taken by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
</div><div>If a deponent resides out of state, the deposition may be taken by video conference or telephone.  The parties will not be required to travel to California, and the attorneys will not be required to travel out of state.”
</div><div>[Order, section 4], emphasis added. 
</div><div>&nbsp;With respect to document production, the Order provides:
</div><div>“Production of Documents:  Within 60 days of service of this Order both plaintiff and defendant shall provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side(s):
</div><div>a.	Purchase or lease contracts concerning the subject vehicle, including any associated documents reflecting OEM or aftermarket equipment installed at the dealership, ELWs or service contracts, and any other writings signed by the plaintiff at the point of sale.
</div><div>b.	Work orders, repair orders, and invoices (including accounting and warranty versions) for any maintenance, service and repair activity concerning the subject vehicles.
</div><div>c.	Rental car or loaner agreements regarding alternative transportation provided during service or repair visits concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>d.	Records of communications with dealer personnel, and/or factory representatives and defendant’s call center or customer assistance personnel concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>e.	Warrant claims submitted to and/or approved by defendant concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>f.	Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual or similar policies or claim-handling procedures published by Defendant from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>g.	Defendant’s written statements of policy and/or procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase or replacement pursuant to “Lemon Law” claims, including ones brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>h.	A list of or compilation of customer complaints in defendant’s electronically stored information database that are substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by plaintiff, in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.  A substantially similar customer complaint would be the same nature of reported symptom, malfunction, dashboard indicator light, or other manifestation of a repair problem as the description listed in any work order or repair order for the subject vehicle, other than routine or scheduled maintenance items.  The list provided by defendant may be in the chart or spreadsheet format, and shall include the VIN, date of repair visit, dealership or other reporting location, and text of the other customers’ reported complaint, but shall not include the other customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personal identifying information.
</div><div>i.	Technical Service Bulletins and Recall Notices for vehicle purchased or leased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.
</div><div>j.	Copies of any repair instruction, bulletin, or other diagnostic/repair procedure identified in any of the repair order/invoice records for the subject vehicle.
</div><div>k.	Receipts or other written evidence supporting any incidental or consequential damages claimed by plaintiff.
</div><div>If a party believes any of this information should be subject to a protective order, that party shall serve and file a proposed protective order within 5 days of this Order and the parties shall meet and confer as to agreeable language for the same.  The default will be the standard Protective Order provided by the LASC in its website.
</div><div>The information may be provided to the opposing party in electronic form as a PDF at the option of the producing party.
</div><div>Plaintiff and defendant shall serve verification with the documents they produce.
</div><div>Any additional requests for documents may only be propounded by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
</div><div>[Order section (2)(a)].
</div><div>The parties are also directed to the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, entitled Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation) (Notice).  That Notice provides:
</div><div>“When the court is faced with a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, the court will usually order that the plaintiff and defendant provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side: 
</div><div>1. Defendant shall produce the “Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual” published by Defendant and provided to its authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>2. Defendant shall produce any internal analysis or investigation regarding defects alleged in plaintiff's complaint in vehicles for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. This includes Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins. Defendant is not required to do a search of emails. 
</div><div>3. Defendant shall produce any customer complaints relating to defects alleged in plaintiff’s complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>4. Defendant shall produce all documents evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>5. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>6. Communications with dealer, factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>7. Warranty claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>8. Purchase and/or lease contract concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>9. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>10. Any documents supporting plaintiff’s claim for incidental and/or consequential damages.”
</div><div>&nbsp;With respect to the documents requested, production is to be made and the depositions conducted in accordance with the Order and Notice.  If there is some further dispute concerning the production of documents or the conduct of the depositions, the parties must comply with the Order and Notice, and meet and confer in good faith concerning any outstanding discovery in light of the Order and Notice, and, if necessary, pursue a further motion which must be accompanied by a separate statement reflecting the then current status of any discovery disputes, including in that separate statement as to each request and response any applicable language of the Order and Notice. 
</div><div>The court notes that the file shows that on May 8, 2023, the parties lodged a Stipulation and Protective Order—Confidential Designation Only, which was signed by the court as its order and filed on May 9, 2023.  This protective order should eliminate the need for the parties to assert any objections based on confidentiality, trade secrets or private or propriety information.

</div><div>Case Name:	Fearnside v. General Motors LLC
</div><div>MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO
</div><div>DEPOSITION QUESTIONS
</div><div>Moving Party:		Plaintiff Keith Fearnside   
</div><div>Responding Party: 	Defendant General Motors LLC   
</div><div>Name of Deponent:   PMQ of General Motors LLC   			   			
</div><div>Status of Deponent:	Defendant or defendant affiliate (party)
</div><div>DEPO ATTENDANCE REQUIRED BY:
</div><div>Formal Notice	
</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED BY MOVING PARTY:
</div><div>Order compelling defendant to testify at deposition with respect to the specific questions which defendant refused to answer at initial deposition 
</div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
</div><div>Plaintiff Keith Fearnside alleges that in January of 2021 plaintiff purchased a new 2021 Chevrolet Suburban, which was warranted by defendant General Motors LLC (GM), with defendant providing an express warranty and an implied warranty, including warranties that the vehicle was fit for the ordinary purposes for which vehicles are used and that it was acceptable in the trade. 
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiff with nonconformities to warranty, including the liftgate, sidesteps, rattle noises, transmission, water pump, oil leaks and other defects. 
</div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the applicable warranty periods.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff presented the vehicle to defendant’s authorized facilities for repair of these nonconformities on at least seven occasions, and that those facilities verified the concerns and performed several repair attempts, but, ultimately, many if not all of the problems remain unrepaired. 
</div><div>The complaint alleges two causes of action, for Breach of Express Warranty, and Breach of Implied Warranty.
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Relief is sought under CCP section 2025.480(a), which provides:
</div><div>“(a) If a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”
</div><div>A trial court’s determination of a motion to compel discovery cannot be overturned in the absence of an abuse of discretion.  2,022 Ranch v. Superior Court (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1387.
</div><div>&nbsp;Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action...if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” 
</div><div>CCP § 2025.460(b), governing deposition conduct, provides, in pertinent part:
</div><div>“(a) The protection of information from discovery on the ground that it is privileged or that it is a protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010) is waived unless a specific objection to its disclosure is timely made during the deposition.
</div><div>(b) Errors and irregularities of any kind occurring at the oral examination that might be cured if promptly presented are waived unless a specific objection to them is timely made during the deposition. These errors and irregularities include, but are not limited to, those relating to the manner of taking the deposition, to the oath or affirmation administered, to the conduct of a party, attorney, deponent, or deposition officer, or to the form of any question or answer. Unless the objecting party demands that the taking of the deposition be suspended to permit a motion for a protective order under Sections 2025.420 and 2025.470, the deposition shall proceed subject to the objection.
</div><div>(c) Objections to the competency of the deponent, or to the relevancy, materiality, or admissibility at trial of the testimony or of the materials produced are unnecessary and are not waived by failure to make them before or during the deposition.”
</div><div>Under Los Angeles County Local Rules, Appendix 3.A, Guidelines for Civility in Litigation, subdivision (e), governing depositions:
</div><div>“(7) Counsel defending a deposition should limit objections to those that are well founded and necessary for the protection of the client’s interest. Counsel should bear in mind that most objections are preserved and need to be interposed only when the form of a question is defective or privileged information is sought….
</div><div>(9) Counsel should not direct a deponent to refuse to answer questions unless they seek privileged information or are manifestly irrelevant or calculated to harass.” 
</div><div>&nbsp; The separate statement shows that the motion concerns three deposition questions. 
</div><div>Question 1
</div><div>Q: Doesn't General Motors have a way to monitor a consumer repair history to identify if a vehicle should be repurchased? · · · · ·
</div><div>Question 2
</div><div>Q: So General Motors like if they can monitor that data in order to issue Technical Service Bulletins, wouldn't they also be able to monitor that data to determine if a vehicle should be repurchased?
</div><div>Question 3
</div><div>Q: You mentioned something earlier. You said that there was no customer contact from Mr. Fearnside expressing the issues that he has with the vehicle.  Is it General Motors' belief that the customer needs to first contact them before they can even have a discussion about offering a repurchase?
</div><div>As to Questions 1 and 2, counsel for GM objected that the questions were “outside the scope and purview for which the witness is being presented regarding GM's policy and procedure” as it pertains to repurchase. The witness was then instructed not to answer.  As to Question 3, counsel for GM stated, “Same objection and same instruction not to answer.”   
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that under statute, set forth above, and case law the refusal of a defendant to answer any question at deposition through use of a claim that the question is outside the scope of discovery is without merit, as the only grounds to instruct a witness not to answer a question in deposition is for privilege. The instruction here was clearly not based on privilege. 
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that the questions sought information relevant to plaintiff’s claim for restitution under the Song-Beverly Act, as well as plaintiff’s claim for civil penalties under Civil Code section 1794(c). 
</div><div>Under the Song-Beverly Act, in connection with express warranties:  
</div><div>“(d) 
</div><div>&nbsp;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
</div><div>&nbsp;(2) If the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph (A) or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph (B). However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.”
</div><div>Civil Code §1793.2(d). 
</div><div>&nbsp;Under Civil Code § 1794 (a), “Any buyer of consumer goods who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.” 
</div><div>&nbsp;With respect to civil penalties, plaintiff relies on Civil Code § 1794 (c), which provides, in pertinent part:
</div><div>“If the buyer establishes that the failure to comply was willful, the judgment may include, in addition to the amounts recovered under subdivision (a), a civil penalty which shall not exceed two times the amount of the actual damages.” 
</div><div>&nbsp;It is clear that questions concerning the practices engaged in by GM to monitor consumer repair histories or company data to identify if vehicles should be repurchased would be directly relevant to a claim that the failure in this instance to comply was improper, was based on established improper patterns, and was possibly willful.  
</div><div>More specifically, the question concerning plaintiff’s contact with GM prior to filing suit, or lack thereof, is directly relevant to whether GM fulfilled its duties under the Song Beverly Act, as plaintiff cites Second District authority under which it is held there is no obligation under the Act for a consumer to contact the responsible party before filing suit.  Krotin v. Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 294, 302-303 (“the Act does not require consumers to take any affirmative steps to secure relief for the failure of a manufacturer to service or repair a vehicle to conform to the applicable warranties—other than, of course, permitting the manufacturer a reasonable opportunity to repair the vehicle.”)  
</div><div>&nbsp;It is clear that the questions at issue seek the discovery of discoverable material.  Hence, the questions should have been answered.  
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant in opposition argues that the objection was proper, as the questions were outside the scope and purview for which the PMQ witness was ordered to testify, but concern GM’s policies and procedures, and that the requested information does not relate to the claims, defense, and issues in this case so is not subject to discovery. 
</div><div>&nbsp;As to the issue of discoverability, as discussed above, the court finds there is no question that the deposition questions at issue seek discoverable information, and any objection or argument on this ground is rejected. Such an objection certainly did not warrant instructions not to answer the questions. As set forth above, under the Los Angeles County Local Rules Guidelines for Civility in Litigation, “Counsel should not direct a deponent to refuse to answer questions unless they seek privileged information or are manifestly irrelevant or calculated to harass.”  The questions here are not “manifestly irrelevant.”    
</div><div>&nbsp;With respect to the argument that the questions are beyond the scope of the deposition notice, the First Amended Notice of Deposition includes six categories of matters on which the deponent is to be examined, including:
</div><div>“1. Questions relating to why YOU did not repurchase or replace the SUBJECT VEHICLE prior to the date Plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed….
</div><div>5. Questions relating to any affirmative steps taken by YOU to determine if the SUBJECT VEHICLE qualified for repurchase or replacement prior to the date Plaintiffs’ lawsuit was filed.”
</div><div>[Ex. 3, Depo. Notice, Ex. A] 
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant argues that all categories are limited to plaintiff’s vehicle, and that general discussions concerning policies and procedures do not fall within the notice. 
</div><div>&nbsp;The matters stated are broad enough to encompass the information sought in the deposition, as information concerning what information was used or available to make the determination concerning the qualification for repurchase would have informed this particular transaction.  Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to ask questions pertinent to the categories and facts concerning what is done in the situation.  In any case, the discovery of facts concerning how determinations are made in general or policies and procedures employed to make these decisions are fairly encompassed by the matters noticed.  This court does not consider a PMQ deposition notice a rigid script for the conduct of a deposition.  Under CCP section 2025.230, with respect to the deposition of a person most knowledgeable: 
</div><div>“If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested.  In that event the deponent shall designate and produce at deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the deponent.”
</div><div>Defendant argues in the opposition that the questions relate to GM’s policies and procedures generally, and that this information is not within the control or expertise of the deponent, as GM designated its PMQ to testify as to matters related to plaintiff’s vehicle, not GM’s repurchase or replacement policies or procedures, and GM’s witness likely would not have been able to provide accurate answers to the questions.   
</div><div>If it is true that the information sought is outside the scope of the responsibilities and expertise of the witness, the witness should be permitted to answer the question, explain that it is outside his responsibilities, or area of expertise, and any information reasonably available to him.  At that point, the examiner should be permitted to explore why the witness does not know the answer, particularly with respect to the evaluation of plaintiff’s vehicle, as well as who or what department within defendant’s corporate structure would be likely to have that information.  Plaintiff notes in the moving papers that the PMQ who appeared testified that he has been employed with GM for 24 years, serves as a senior technical expert, and has also served as an expert in litigation.  [Thompson Depo. Transcript, Ex. 4, pp. 13, 15].  Under the circumstances, plaintiff should have at the very least been permitted to explore why this witness was not qualified by his position, experience, or expertise to answer the subject questions. This information is very basic discovery which should have been permitted to go forward without the interference of instructions not to answer the questions.  
</div><div>The motion accordingly is granted, and the witness ordered to answer these questions. 
</div><div>Under CCP §2025.480:
</div><div>“(e) If the court determines that the answer or production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be given, or the production be made on the resumption of the deposition.” 
</div><div>Such an order is made here.
</div><div>Sanctions
</div><div>&nbsp;Plaintiff seeks sanctions for the expense of having to prepare and pursue this motion.   
</div><div>&nbsp;Under CCP § 2025.480 (j):
</div><div>“(j) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
</div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436. 
</div><div>&nbsp;Here, defendant has unsuccessfully opposed the motion.  Defendant argues that it was substantially justified in designating and presenting its PMQ to testify as to the categories in plaintiff’s deposition notice and declining to answer questions that were outside the scope of the categories in the deposition notice and not relevant to plaintiff’s claims in this case.  As discussed above, these objections are without merit, and certainly were not proper grounds for instructing the witness not to answer the subject questions.  Defendant’s conduct was not substantially justified but fell outside of long recognized and observed protocols for conducting depositions and necessitated this motion.    
</div><div>&nbsp;Sanctions are awarded. 
</div><div>The sanctions requested in the notice and declaration are $3,150.00.  The declaration breakdown by hours actually supports sanctions in a total sum of $3,675.00, but the court will award only the amount which was formally noticed. The motion and separate statement are thorough, and the expenses associated with the motion are reasonable.  Therefore, sanctions are awarded in the full noticed amount of $3,150.00 as requested. 
</div><div>RULING:
</div><div>Plaintiff Keith Fearnside’s Motion to Compel Testimony at Deposition is GRANTED.   
</div><div>The deponent, Brian Thompson, General Motors LLC’s Person Most Qualified, is ordered to give answers to the subject questions and reasonable follow-up questions on the resumption of the deposition, to take place before October 4, 2024.  Objections may be interposed, if appropriate, and will be preserved, but the witness is not to be instructed not to answer.    
</div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $3,150.00 (7.0 hours @ $525/hour) (7 hours requested) [Amount Requested in Notice $3,150.00], which sum is to be awarded in favor of plaintiff Keith Fearnside and against defendant General Motors LLC, payable within 30 days.  CCP § 2025.480 (j).

</div><div>Case No: 	23 GDCV01384			Trial Date:	February 10, 2025  
</div><div>Case Name:	Gharib v. Maserati North American, Inc., et al. 
</div><div>MOTIONS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
</div><div>(3 Motions)
</div><div>Moving Party: 	Plaintiff Fadi Gharib  
</div><div>Responding Party:	Defendant Maserati North America, Inc.    
</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:
</div><div>Responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One 
</div><div>Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One 
</div><div>Order deeming the truth of matters admitted in Requests for Admissions 
</div><div>MONETARY SANCTION:
</div><div>&nbsp;None sought in moving papers
</div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
</div><div>Plaintiff Fadi Gharib alleges that in June of 2022 plaintiff leased a 2022 Maserati Levante, in connection with which defendant Maserati North America, Inc. (Maserati) issued a written warranty, in which defendant Maserati undertook to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance. 
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiff with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities, including steering, suspension, electrical, engine and transmission system defects.  
</div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the defects manifested themselves in the vehicle within the applicable warranty period, and substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff delivered the vehicle to an authorized repair facility to repair the nonconformities, but defendant has been unable to conform the vehicle to warranty after a reasonable number of repair attempts. 
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that notwithstanding plaintiff’s entitlement, defendant FCA US LLC has failed to either promptly replace the vehicle or to promptly make restitution.   
</div><div>The complaint also alleges that plaintiff delivered the vehicle to defendant Russell Westbrook Alfa Romeo Maserati Fiat for repairs on numerous occasions, and that defendant Russell Westbrook Alfa Romeo Maserati Fiat breached its duty to plaintiff to use ordinary care and skill by failing to properly store, prepare, and repair the vehicle in accordance with industry standards. 
</div><div>The complaint alleges three causes of action for Violation of the Song Beverly Act, for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation of section 1793.2, as well as a fourth cause of action for negligent repair. 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Defendant Maserati in opposition to the motions indicates that prior to the hearing of the motions, defendant served plaintiff with verified responses to the subject discovery.  [Sharp Decl., para.  9].
</div><div>Defendant has not submitted with the opposition copies of the responses to permit the court to confirm that the responses are verified, or when they were served.  While this is not ideal, the court, based on counsel’s sworn declaration that the “verified responses” were served on August 20, 2024, finds the motions moot. [Sharp Decl., para. 9].  
</div><div>If at the hearing it appears that verified responses were not served as represented prior to the hearing, the motions would not be considered moot. 
</div><div>However, as pointed out in the opposition papers, this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation, now posted and available on the Los Angeles Superior Court website in connection with this Department, Glendale Courthouse, Department D.   
</div><div>Pursuant to that Order, “any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the Court.”  [Order section (1)(a)]. 
</div><div>The order sets forth the following provisions concerning discovery in Song-Beverly matters which appear to address the discovery issues raised by the current motions. 
</div><div>With respect to Interrogatories, the Order provides:
</div><div>“Interrogatories:  Within the time limits allowed by law, both plaintiff and defendant may propound one set of Judicial Council Form Interrogatories and one set of maximum of 35 special interrogatories.  Any additional special interrogatories may only be propounded by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).”
</div><div>[Order section (3)].
</div><div>The special interrogatories submitted with the moving papers far exceed the 35 special interrogatory limit, as there are 68 special interrogatories. 
</div><div>With respect to Requests for Production of Documents, the Order provides:
</div><div>“Production of Documents:  Within 60 days of service of this Order both plaintiff and defendant shall provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side(s):
</div><div>a.	Purchase or lease contracts concerning the subject vehicle, including any associated documents reflecting OEM or aftermarket equipment installed at the dealership, ELWs or service contracts, and any other writings signed by the plaintiff at the point of sale.
</div><div>b.	Work orders, repair orders, and invoices (including accounting and warranty versions) for any maintenance, service and repair activity concerning the subject vehicles.
</div><div>c.	Rental car or loaner agreements regarding alternative transportation provided during service or repair visits concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>d.	Records of communications with dealer personnel, and/or factory representatives and defendant’s call center or customer assistance personnel concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>e.	Warrant claims submitted to and/or approved by defendant concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>f.	Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual or similar policies or claim-handling procedures published by Defendant from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>g.	Defendant’s written statements of policy and/or procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase or replacement pursuant to “Lemon Law” claims, including ones brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>h.	A list of or compilation of customer complaints in defendant’s electronically stored information database that are substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by plaintiff, in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.  A substantially similar customer complaint would be the same nature of reported symptom, malfunction, dashboard indicator light, or other manifestation of a repair problem as the description listed in any work order or repair order for the subject vehicle, other than routine or scheduled maintenance items.  The list provided by defendant may be in the chart or spreadsheet format, and shall include the VIN, date of repair visit, dealership or other reporting location, and text of the other customers’ reported complaint, but shall not include the other customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personal identifying information.
</div><div>i.	Technical Service Bulletins and Recall Notices for vehicle purchased or leased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.
</div><div>j.	Copies of any repair instruction, bulletin, or other diagnostic/repair procedure identified in any of the repair order/invoice records for the subject vehicle.
</div><div>k.	Receipts or other written evidence supporting any incidental or consequential damages claimed by plaintiff.
</div><div>If a party believes any of this information should be subject to a protective order, that party shall serve and file a proposed protective order within 5 days of this Order and the parties shall meet and confer as to agreeable language for the same.  The default will be the standard Protective Order provided by the LASC in its website.
</div><div>The information may be provided to the opposing party in electronic form as a PDF at the option of the producing party.
</div><div>Plaintiff and defendant shall serve verification with the documents they produce.
</div><div>Any additional requests for documents may only be propounded by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
</div><div>[Order section (2)(a)-(k)].
</div><div>The parties are also directed to the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, entitled Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation) (Notice).  That Notice provides:
</div><div>“When the court is faced with a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, the court will usually order that the plaintiff and defendant provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side: 
</div><div>1. Defendant shall produce the “Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual” published by Defendant and provided to its authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>2. Defendant shall produce any internal analysis or investigation regarding defects alleged in plaintiff's complaint in vehicles for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. This includes Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins. Defendant is not required to do a search of emails. 
</div><div>3. Defendant shall produce any customer complaints relating to defects alleged in plaintiff’s complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>4. Defendant shall produce all documents evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>5. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>6. Communications with dealer, factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>7. Warranty claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>8. Purchase and/or lease contract concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>9. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>10. Any documents supporting plaintiff’s claim for incidental and/or consequential damages.”
</div><div>The motions concerning responses to interrogatories and responses to requests for production of documents accordingly are denied without prejudice until the parties have had the opportunity to comply with the Order.  The parties are ordered to engage in good faith meet and confer concerning the outstanding discovery in light of the Order, and, if necessary, reschedule the motions and file new papers and supporting documentation, including separate statements reflecting the then current status of the discovery disputes.  Separate statements should also set forth verbatim the relevant language of the Order and Notice where applicable.  
</div><div>The court notes with respect to these particular disputes that the court expects Code compliant responses, and unnecessary objections will be overruled.  
</div><div>Specifically, with respect to a statement of compliance with document production requests, CCP section 2031.220 requires:
</div><div>“A statement that a party to whom an inspection demand has been directed will comply with the particular demand shall state that the production, inspection, and related activity demanded will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is being make will be included in the production.”
</div><div>With respect to a statement of inability to comply, CCP section 2031.230 requires:
</div><div>“A representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for inspection shall affirm that a diligent search and a reasonably inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.   This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party.   The statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.”
</div><div>The Order does not provide for the propounding of Requests for Admissions, but permits discovery by means of Production of Documents, Interrogatories, Depositions and Vehicle Inspection, as limited above.  The  moving papers provide no stipulation or court order permitting the propounding of this form of discovery in this matter, as required by the Order, at section (1)(c) (providing that the parties may “stipulate, in writing, to modify” the orders, and that a party may “seek to modify and/or delete any of these orders, via noticed motion, upon good cause.”)     
</div><div>&nbsp;The motion to deem requests for admission admitted is denied without prejudice to plaintiff complying with the Order. 
</div><div>Sanctions
</div><div>The moving papers do not seek monetary sanctions, but defendant in the oppositions requests monetary sanctions for the expense of having to oppose these motions.   Defendant argues that plaintiff’s counsel has misused the discovery process by serving discovery in contravention of the court’s Case Management Order, and, when this fact was brought to counsel’s attention, ignoring defendant’s correspondence.  Defendant argues that plaintiff filed these motions without first reaching out to establish a responsive date, and refused to withdraw the baseless motions, even after it was pointed out that the discovery had been improperly served and after code-compliant verified responses were nevertheless served.  
</div><div>With respect to interrogatories, under CCP § 2030.290(c), “The court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  A similar provision applies to document demands.  See CCP § 2031.300(c).
</div><div>CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuse of the discovery process includes  “(b) Using a discovery method in a manner that does not comply with its specified procedures,” “(c) Employing a discovery method in a manner or to the extent that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense,” and “(h) Making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery.”  Where there has been such conduct, under CCP § 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).  
</div><div>While the court does not appreciate that plaintiff has propounded discovery outside the boundaries of the Order without obtaining a stipulation or leave of court to do so, and has refused to withdraw these motions before the expense of opposing them was incurred unnecessarily, the court also notes that there has been some confusion concerning the obligation of a party to timely respond to that portion of a party’s discovery which is encompassed by the Order.  
</div><div>Under the circumstances, the court does not award monetary sanctions to defendant.  
</div><div>However, the court will expect in the future that the parties fully comply with the Order and Notice and will expect that the expense shifting mechanism of discovery sanctions can be properly invoked if appropriate. 
</div><div>RULING:

</div><div>4)	Battery 		v.   Defendant Aidan 
</div><div>SUMMARY OF FACTS:
</div><div>Plaintiff James Soleimani, who originally appeared in this action as a minor appearing through his GAL, Marta Recasens, evidently is no longer a minor and is appearing on his own behalf.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff enrolled at defendant Saint Francis High School of La Canada Flintridge (SFHS) in August of 2020, and that it was important to plaintiff and his family that plaintiff attend a Roman Catholic high school for various strongly held personal reasons.  Plaintiff alleges that he was particularly interested in playing organized football with the SFHS teams that participate in defendant California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) organized games against other CIF teams in the Southern California section of CIF.  
</div><div>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from early 2020 through May 2021, SFHS had no in-person instruction, and no active football program.  In June of 2021, plaintiff began attending SFHS’s football camp, and won a place on the Junior Varsity team.  Plaintiff alleges that in August of 2021, plaintiff suffered an injury to his shoulder during football practice and was in October 2021 evaluated by a doctor and also diagnosed with a tear in the tendon of a finger and prescribed no PE or sports for two weeks.
</div><div>In October of 2021, plaintiff alleges that during the first half of a SFHS football game, plaintiff was on the sidelines due to his medical restrictions, wearing his football uniform but not wearing pads or a helmet, when defendant Aidan Austin (Aidan), a fellow student, while wearing his football helmet, aggressively accosted plaintiff verbally for not being tough enough to play through injuries.  Plaintiff alleges despite Aidan’s continual harassment, plaintiff did not engage in any physical retaliation against Aidan, but Aidan, with his helmet still on, butted plaintiff (who was not wearing a helmet) in the face repeatedly, injuring plaintiff.  Plaintiff alleges he did not fight back or do anything other than attempt to shield himself from Aidan’s criminal battery. 
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that no defendant took any significant disciplinary action against Aidan for the helmet assault, although it occurred in open view of hundreds of people, including one or more of the other defendants.  
</div><div>At halftime, Aidan, obviously undeterred by any defendants, hunted plaintiff down in the weight room and, unprovoked, put plaintiff in a choke hold and beat him repeatedly over the head.  Plaintiff alleges that the following day, upon receiving reports of Aidan’s unprovoked violence against plaintiff, defendant John Jordan, Dean of Students of SFHS, punished both of them equally, by suspending them both from Friday’s football game.  
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, Aidan again aggressively hunted plaintiff down in the locker room, threatened him, and proceeded to knee plaintiff in the groin, pulled plaintiff’s jacket over plaintiff’s head and repeatedly struck plaintiff in the head with a closed fist.  Plaintiff alleges that he did not fight back and sought only to shield himself, and the incident was videotaped and viewed by Jordan, which showed older players dancing and celebrating the assault.  It also documents that plaintiff never struck back.  Plaintiff alleges that again defendants responded by treating plaintiff and Aidan equally, as if both were equally culpable for Aidan’s unprovoked criminal attack, which defendants again did nothing to stop or prevent.      
</div><div>The complaint alleges that in mid-October, another SFHS student reported to plaintiff that the student had seen Aidan carrying a knife on campus, and warned plaintiff to stay away from Aidan because he was armed.  In the latter half of October, when plaintiff was intimidated and fearful of a knife armed Aidan again attacking him, plaintiff had a video displayed SnapChat conversation with another SFHS student, in which the other student viewed, near plaintiff, an airsoft gun, and plaintiff made a joke about the airsoft gun being a real firearm. Plaintiff later clarified that it was not real and that he was joking.   
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that in November of 2021, plaintiff and his mother, Marta Recasens, met with Jordan to discuss what Jordan claimed was his and SFHS’s investigation of the foregoing altercations and their aftermath.  Jordan informed them that Jordan had a grainy photo of a gun that plaintiff had supposedly displayed on social media, but never presented this image to plaintiff or Recasens.  Plaintiff alleges that during the investigation, Jordan did view the videotape where Aidan attacked plaintiff in the locker room, and interviewed other football players who informed him that plaintiff was being threatened and harassed by Aidan and that plaintiff feared for his life, but did not take proper measures to prevent, protect plaintiff or to properly punish Aidan, the aggressor.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff was under the authority of defendants as a student athlete who qualified to be in the football program and should have been afforded the protection of those authorities.  
</div><div>The day following the meeting with Jordan, plaintiff and Recasen met with SFHS’s Disciplinary Board, comprised of defendant Jordan, defendant Thomas Moran, Principal of SFHS, and six other individuals, in which plaintiff read a statement about the altercations and their aftermath, and admitted in his statement that within a week of Aidan’s most recent beating, plaintiff remembered having commented as a joke on social media that an airsoft gun the plaintiff owned was a real firearm.  Plaintiff alleges that he contritely admitted this joke as inappropriate and asked forgiveness.  Plaintiff was then expelled. 
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that had defendants acted more promptly in disciplining and either suspending or expelling Aidan prior to the last assault on plaintiff, plaintiff would not have been frightened and intimidated into joking that the airsoft gun was real, which joke led to plaintiff’s expulsion.    
</div><div>The First Amended Complaint alleges that plaintiff has been damaged as a result of his expulsion, including mental suffering, the loss of the companionship and society of teachers and friends at SFHS, and due to the disciplinary record created with the expulsion, finding it difficult to be accepted as a student at a comparable religious high school and, later, colleges.  Plaintiff also alleges that at the new high school in which plaintiff enrolled, he was not allowed to play football for one year due to CIF rules, despite being told by Jordan that no such disciplinary reasons statement would appear on plaintiff’s record.  In contrast, Aidan, who was not expelled but suspended, and transferred to a different school, was allowed to participate in football after only six months.  
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff appealed the expulsion ruling to CIF explaining the circumstances, but CIF would not change its decision. Plaintiff alleges that CIF failed to properly investigate the matter after it failed to protect plaintiff.   
</div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that prior to Aidan’s attacks, plaintiff had been an honor roll student, but his academic career was damaged when he failed courses because of the stress he endured from the bullying, beating and expulsion, that plaintiff’s football career was harmed as he was not able to play football for over a year, and that plaintiff as a result of the beatings and expulsion, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.  
</div><div>The FAC also names as defendant Antonio Marti, the President of SFHS.
</div><div>The FAC alleges that all defendants other than Aidan breached their duty of properly supervising Aidan to ensure that he did not bully or physically abuse plaintiff, and breached their duty by failing to suspend or expel Aidan when Aidan repeatedly battered plaintiff, and that CIF breached its duty to provide protection for plaintiff by not instituting rules and guidelines on bullying and breached its duty in not ensuring that Aidan received the same consequences as plaintiff.    
</div><div>The FAC alleges causes of action against Aidan only for IIED and battery. 
</div><div>The file shows that on November 27, 2024, the moving defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint.   
</div><div>Defendant CIF filed a demurrer to the complaint, which was heard on April 12, 2024, and was sustained with leave to amend as to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED.  
</div><div>Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on May 20, 2024.  Defendant CIF again filed a demurrer to the first and second causes of action of the FAC, which was heard on July 12, 2024.  The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.   
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Procedural 
</div><div>Untimely Opposition
</div><div>Defendants in the reply argue that the court should disregard the opposition papers because they were untimely. 
</div><div>Under CCP §1005(b):
</div><div>“All papers opposing a motion…shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days… before the hearing.” 
</div><div>&nbsp;Under CRC Rule 3.1300(d), “If the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate.” 
</div><div>&nbsp;Here, the opposition was filed and served on July 10, 2024 at 4:30 pm for a July 19, 2024 hearing date.  Nine court days before the hearing fell on July 8, 2024.  The opposition was accordingly filed and served two court days late.  This tardiness has been inconvenient for the court and the courtroom staff, and unfair to the moving parties who have been deprived of those court days within which to file a timely reply.  The court, in its discretion, could refuse to consider the untimely opposition, but the court elects not to do so.  The court will consider the opposition, only because defendants were able to file a timely reply.   However, plaintiff is cautioned that in the future the court may refuse to consider papers not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation. 
</div><div>No Previous Demurrer 
</div><div>&nbsp;As noted above, the moving defendants did not previously file a demurrer to the original complaint but filed an answer.  The FAC was only permitted to be filed because co-defendant CIF had successfully brought a demurrer to the original pleading, and plaintiff was permitted leave to amend. 
</div><div>Under CCP § 430.41(b):
</div><div>“(b) A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The allegations against the moving defendants do not appear to have been significantly modified in the FAC, and it appears that the arguments now made by moving defendants could have been raised in connection with the original complaint but were not.  The moving papers do not explain why a demurrer is now appropriate, when moving defendants did not previously argue that plaintiff’s pleading was insufficient.  
</div><div>&nbsp;The court will hear argument whether it should disregard the demurrer for failure to comply with CCP § 430.41(b). However, the court will consider the demurrer on its merits. Again, the parties are cautioned that the court in the future may refuse to consider pleadings not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation. 
</div><div>Substantive 
</div><div>First Cause of Action—Negligence and Second Cause of Action—NIED 
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendants Saint Francis High School (SFHS) and individual defendants Antonio Marti, Thomas Moran and John Jordan demur to the two causes of action brought against them for negligence and NIED, without a clear discussion of each cause of action.   Defendants argue that the FAC does not allege any facts showing that plaintiff has any viable negligence-based causes of action against defendants, as SFHS cannot be held liable for plaintiff’s own conduct which plaintiff admits in the FAC led to his expulsion.  Essentially, defendants seem to argue that defendants did not have a legal duty to plaintiff to protect plaintiff from his own poor choices.  	
</div><div>&nbsp;The argument appears to be more specifically that plaintiff’s theory of liability against SFHS is too attenuated to create a duty on the part of SFHS. 
</div><div>&nbsp;To plead a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must allege the following elements: The existence of a duty of care, breach of that duty, and an injury proximately caused by the breach.   Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917.  
</div><div>Negligent infliction of emotional distress requires negligence and severe emotional disturbance.  Marlene F. v. Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588.  
</div><div>To support a NIED claim here, plaintiff must have suffered damages as a result of a duty “assumed by the defendant or imposed on the defendant as a matter of law, or that arises out of a relationship between the two.”  Burgess v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1073, quoting Marlene F., at 590. See also Potter v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 965, 984-985  (“That duty may be imposed by law, be assumed by the defendant, or exist by virtue of a special relationship…”)
</div><div>It is recognized that the issue of whether a duty of care was owed is a question of law.  See Clarke v. Hoek (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 208, 213 (“The question of the existence of a legal duty of care in a given factual situation presents a question of law which is to be determined by the courts alone.”). Garcia v. Paramount Citrus Association, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1452 (“The existence of a duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff is a question of law for the court, reviewed de novo on appeal.”)
</div><div>Defendants argue that foreseeability is of primary importance in establishing the element of duty, and that no supervision is required where the school has no reason to think any is required.   Defendants argue that the allegations are too attenuated here that plaintiff made a joke about an airgun being a real firearm and had defendants acted more promptly in disciplining defendant Aidan prior to the last assault on plaintiff, plaintiff would not have made the comment about the gun which caused plaintiff to be expelled. 
</div><div>The argument seems to be that defendants had no specific duty concerning preventing plaintiff from admitting he had made an improper representation concerning the air gun.  However, the duty and breaches of duty alleged in the pleading include various other conduct and wrongs which have nothing to do with this theory.   
</div><div>Specifically, the first cause of action alleges that defendants owed SFHS students a “duty to exercise reasonable care and to take reasonable steps to protect said students from bullying, including without limitation by (a) adequately supervising students to ensure that no bullying or other improper physical abuse by students occurs against other students, and (b) suspending or expelling other students who have engaged, even once, in battery of other students.”  [FAC, para.54].  The cause of action alleges that defendants “breached their duty by not properly supervising AIDAN to ensure that he did not bully and/or physically abuse Plaintiff.”  [FAC, para. 60].  It is also alleged that plaintiff was harmed including that his “mental state suffered,” and he “felt threatened” by Aidan.  [FAC, para. 62].  
</div><div>The general allegations include detailed allegations concerning three bullying batteries by Aidan against plaintiff.  The first two incidents, defendants are alleged to have been clearly aware of, and defendants are alleged to have failed to properly investigate and act on those incidents, when there was video evidence showing that plaintiff had no responsibility for the encounters, and should not have been disciplined, and Aidan, as the aggressor, should have been disciplined more seriously.  [FAC, paras. 22-26; 31-34, 38].  
</div><div>Both sides rely on Leger v. Stockton Unified School Dist. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1448, in which the court of appeal reversed the trial court’s sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend to an amended complaint brought by a high school student against his school district and his high school’s principal and wrestling coach, alleging they had failed to protect him from an attack by a non-student in a high school restroom.  The court of appeal held:
</div><div>“In this case, we hold that the complaint of a high school student states a cause of action for damages against his school district and its employees. The complaint alleges employees of the district negligently failed to protect plaintiff Jaime Leger from an attack by a nonstudent in a school restroom, where they knew or reasonably should have known the restroom was unsafe and attacks by nonstudents were likely to occur.”
</div><div>Leger, at 1452-1453. 
</div><div>&nbsp;The court of appeal described the duty of care arising in the school setting as follows:
</div><div>“As a general rule, one owes no duty to control the conduct of another, nor to warn those endangered by such conduct. Such a duty may arise, however, if '(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person's conduct, or (b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives the other a right to protection.' (Rest. 2d Torts (1965) § 315; Thompson v. County of Alameda (1980) 27 Cal.3d 741, 751-752 [167 Cal.Rptr. 70, 614 P.2d 728]; Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California (1976) 17 Cal.3d 425 [131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 83 A.L.R.3d 1166].)” (Davidson v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 203 [185 Cal.Rptr. 252, 649 P.2d 894]; see also Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 788-789 [221 Cal.Rptr. 840, 710 P.2d 907]; Williams v. State of California, supra, 34 Cal.3d at p. 23.)
</div><div>In Rodriguez v. Inglewood Unified School Dist. (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 707 [230 Cal.Rptr. 823], the court considered whether a school district could be held liable when a student was assaulted on campus by a nonstudent.  On the question of duty, the court concluded “that a special relationship is formed between a school district and its students so as to impose an affirmative duty on the district to take all reasonable steps to protect its students.” (P. 715.).
</div><div>Although Rodriguez did not address the question, we think it obvious that the individual school employees responsible for supervising plaintiff, such as the principal and the wrestling coach, also had a special relation with plaintiff upon which a duty of care may be founded. (See Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 436.) A contrary conclusion would be wholly untenable in light of the fact that “the right of all students to a school environment fit for learning cannot be questioned. Attendance is mandatory and the aim of all schools is to teach. Teaching and learning cannot take place without the physical and mental well-being of the students. The school premises, in short, must be safe and welcoming. ... [¶] The public school setting is one in which governmental officials are directly in charge of children and their environs, including where they study, eat and play. ... Further, the responsibility of school officials for each of their charges, the children, is heightened as compared to the responsibility of the police for the public in general.” (In re William G. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 550, 563 [221 Cal.Rptr. 118, 709 P.2d 1287].)
</div><div>Rodriguez notwithstanding, defendants still contend they should owe no duty to protect plaintiff from this attack. They correctly contend that neither school districts nor their employees are the insurers of the safety of their students. (Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360].) But plaintiff makes no assertion of strict liability; rather, the complaint pleads negligence. Defendants do owe plaintiff a duty to use the degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with comparable duties, would exercise in the same circumstances. (Ibid.)
</div><div>Of course, in the present circumstances, the existence of a duty of care depends in part on whether the harm to plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable. (See Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 125 [211 Cal.Rptr. 356, 695 P.2d 653].) Neither schools nor their restrooms are dangerous places per se. (Cf. Peterson v. San Francisco Community College Dist., supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 812.) Students are not at risk merely because they are at school. (See Chavez v. Tolleson Elementary School Dist. (1979) 122 Ariz. 472 [595 P.2d 1017, 1 A.L.R.4th 1099].) A contrary conclusion would unreasonably “require virtual round-the-clock supervision or prison-tight security for school premises, ...” (Bartell v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Sch. Dist. (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 492, 500 [147 Cal.Rptr. 898].)
</div><div>Here, however, plaintiff's first amended complaint pled that defendants knew or should have known that he was subject to an unusual risk of harm at a specific location on school grounds. Thus, the complaint alleged defendants knew or should have known that members of the junior varsity wrestling team (including plaintiff) were changing clothes before wrestling practice in the unsupervised boys' restroom, that defendants knew or should have known the unsupervised restroom was unsafe for students, and that attacks were likely to occur there. These allegations sufficiently state that the harm to plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable in the absence of supervision or a warning. Plaintiff had no obligation to plead that prior acts of violence had occurred in the restroom. (See Isaacs v. Huntington Memorial Hospital, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 129.) For example, school authorities who know of threats of violence that they believe are well-founded may not refrain from taking reasonable preventive measures simply because violence has yet to occur. (See id., at pp. 125-126.)
</div><div>Whether plaintiff can prove these allegations, or whether it will be difficult to prove them, are not appropriate questions for a reviewing court when ruling on a demurrer. (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936 [231 Cal.Rptr. 748, 727 P.2d 1029].)
</div><div>Leger, at 1458-1460.  
</div><div>&nbsp;The court of appeal also directly addressed the question of whether a private school, which is not a public school, is subject to a similar duty of care and concluded private schools have such a duty:
</div><div>“As a general rule, it has been held that a [private] school is not required to provide constant supervision over pupils at all times. Thus, no supervision is required where the school has no reason to think any is required. ... It appears that a [private] school has a duty to provide supervision with respect to a particular activity if the school officials could reasonably anticipate that supervision was required ....” (Annot., Tort Liability of Private Schools and Institutions of Higher Learning for Negligence of, or Lack of Supervision By, Teachers and Other Employees or Agents (1971) 38 A.L.R.3d 908, 916, fns. omitted; italics added.)
</div><div>“Where a student is injured in performing a task on the direction of school authorities without supervision, the question of [private] school negligence is one for the jury if there is evidence of the existence of a danger known to the school authorities, who neglect to guard the student against such danger, or if there is an unknown danger which the school, by the exercise of ordinary care as a reasonably prudent person, would have discovered.” (38 A.L.R.3d at p. 919, fn. omitted.) 
</div><div>“Where the liability of the [private] school is sought to be predicated on alleged negligence of teachers or other employees or agents of the school, it is generally recognized that liability on the part of the school may be established under the doctrine of respondeat superior if negligence within the scope of their employment is shown.” (38 A.L.R.3d at p. 912.).”
</div><div>Leger, at 1461-1462
</div><div>Overall, the FAC here similarly alleges breaches of a duty of supervision of students, in this case an actual student as opposed to a non-student, and circumstances showing that the school was aware of violent behavior by the student against plaintiff, but failed to appropriately investigate, or appropriately discipline the aggressor, or take steps to monitor the locker room or promptly review and act on videotapes of incidents of assault, so that subsequent attacks are appropriately viewed as foreseeable.  [FAC, paras. 22-26, 31-34, 38].  A negligence claim against SFHS is alleged on at least one valid recognized theory in the very case law cited by defendants, which is sufficient to withstand demurrer.  
</div><div>Specifically, to the extent defendants focus on the expulsion aspect of the causes of action, this goes to only part of the causes of action, and the court may not sustain a demurrer to only part of a cause of action. A demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action (or to a particular type of damage or remedy), and a cause will survive demurrer if there are sufficient allegations that might entitle the pleader to relief.  Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelop. Agency (2003, 2nd Dist.) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046; PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.   
</div><div>The demurrer accordingly is overruled on this ground. 
</div><div>Defendants also seem to argue that because plaintiff did not report the November 5, 2021 incident involving Aidan, the school had no awareness of the incident until later, so there was no foreseeability. 
</div><div>However, as pointed out in the opposition, and discussed above, the FAC alleges in some depth that defendants were aware of previous incidents between these very two students, and failed to appropriately investigate and determine that Aidan had been the aggressor and was routinely threatening and assaulting plaintiff.  It is alleged that during the investigation, defendant Dean of Students Jordan interviewed other football players who informed him that plaintiff was being threatened and harassed by Aidan and that plaintiff feared for his life, but did not take proper measures to prevent, protect plaintiff or to properly punish Aidan, the aggressor. [FAC, paras. 22-26; 31-34, 38]. This showing is sufficient to allege facts supporting foreseeability.  In fact, in Leger, the court of appeal observed that plaintiff in that case had no obligation to plead prior acts of violence had occurred, as “school authorities who know of threats of violence that they believe are well-founded may not refrain from taking reasonable preventive measure simply because violence has yet to occur.”  Leger, at 1460.  Here, previous acts of violence themselves were known to defendants. The claim is sufficiently pleaded.  
</div><div>The individual defendants argue that the demurrer should be sustained as to these parties because they were acting as directors or officers of the religious corporation which runs SFHS, acting while discharging their duties as agents or employees of the school.  Defendants rely on general agency law, not cases involving schools, and concede that tort liability can be imposed on agents where acts constitute a breach of duty owed to the third person.  
</div><div>As pointed out in the opposition, there is case law under which a special relationship is recognized between individual school employees and students such that a school employee may be individually responsible for a breach of duties arising pursuant to that relationship.  See Leger, 1458-1459 (“we think it obvious that the individual school employees responsible for supervising plaintiff, such as the principal and the wrestling coach, also had a special relation with plaintiff upon which a duty of care may be founded.”)   
</div><div>Here, with respect to the individual defendants, it is alleged that defendant John Jordan, the Dean of Students, was directly involved in handling the alleged incidents of aggression between plaintiff and Aidan, and failed to properly investigate, failed to view available evidence, or failed to act on it once he viewed it, and failed to properly supervise and discipline in connection with harassment and threats of violence.   [FAC, paras. 6, 26, 33, 38, 40, 43].  This showing is sufficient to withstand demurrer. 
</div><div>Similarly, defendant Thomas Moran is alleged to have been principal of SFHS, to have participated in the Disciplinary Board meeting, and to have written a letter to plaintiff’s mother improperly blaming plaintiff for not reporting the incidents, two of which the school was in fact aware, and admitting that video of the locker room incident had been available and viewed by Jordan.  [FAC, paras. 5, 40, 43].  This showing is sufficient to allege a claim against this defendant. 
</div><div>Defendants in reply argue that this is a private religious school, not a public school as was the case in authorities cited by plaintiff.  However, defendants themselves rely on Leger, which involved a private school, and recognized duties owed based on special relationships with students in the school setting. 
</div><div>As noted in Leger, where the liability specifically of a “private” school “is sought to be predicated on alleged negligence of teachers or other employees or agents of the school, it is generally recognized that liability on the part of the school may be established under the doctrine of respondeat superior if negligence within the scope of their employment is shown.” Leger, at 1462, quoting 38 A.L.R.3d at p. 912.
</div><div>The demurrer by defendants Jordan and Moran accordingly is overruled.
</div><div>However, it does not appear that any negligence or wrongful conduct is clearly alleged on the part of defendant Antonio Marti, other than that Marti was the president of SFHS, and vaguely, “directly involved in the underlying events as alleged herein.” [FAC, para. 4].  He is not identified by name in any other part of the FAC.    
</div><div>The opposition does not separately address this named defendant, instead arguing that the FAC alleges that each of the individual defendants had a duty to plaintiff which was breached, as they were present during the expulsion proceeding and, in a position, to stop the attacks on plaintiff by Aidan.  It is not alleged that this defendant was present at the hearing, or how defendant Marti was in a position to stop the attacks on plaintiff.  The demurrer as to this defendant only accordingly is sustained.  Since this is the first challenge to the pleading by this defendant, the demurrer is sustained with one opportunity to amend, if appropriate, to more clearly allege the alleged negligent conduct engaged in by defendant Marti. 
</div><div>The opposition discusses at some length that defendants discriminated against plaintiff with their disparate handling of the situations before defendants.   There is no cause of action alleged for discrimination.  The current causes of action against the moving defendants are for negligence and NIED.  To the extent the opposition seeks leave to amend to expand the disparate treatment and discrimination claims, such leave will not be granted.  If plaintiff finds it appropriate to pursue new causes of action, or otherwise amend the pleading, plaintiff must appropriately seek and obtain advance leave of court to do so. 
</div><div>&nbsp;RULING:
</div><div>Saint Francis High School of LaCanada-Flintridge, Antonio Marti, Thomas Moran and John Jordan’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint:
</div><div>The Court in its discretion has reluctantly considered the untimely opposition to the demurrer, filed and served two court days late, only seven court days prior to the hearing.  Plaintiff is cautioned that in the future the Court may refuse to consider pleadings not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation. 
</div><div>The Court in its discretion has also reluctantly considered the demurrer itself, which was filed in violation of CCP § 430.41(b).  Defendants are cautioned that in the future the Court may refuse to consider pleadings not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules and procedures governing this litigation. 
</div><div>Demurrer by defendants Saint Francis High School of LaCanada-Flintridge, Thomas Moran, and John Jordan is OVERRULED. 
</div><div>Demurrer by defendant Antonio Marti is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND on the ground there are insufficient allegations of any conduct on the part of this defendant in support of a negligence claim.   
</div><div>Ten days leave to amend only to assert negligent conduct on the part of defendant Antonio Marti, if possible. 
</div><div>Plaintiff is not permitted to amend to add new causes of action, or to make further allegations against any of the other defendants without obtaining advance leave of court to do so.

</div><div>Case No:	23 GDCV02285		Trial Date:  None Set 
</div><div>Case Name:	Petrosyan v. Trader Joe’s Company 	
</div><div>MOTION TO COMPEL INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION
</div><div>Moving Party:		Defendant Trader Joe’s Company    
</div><div>Responding Party: 	Plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan    
</div><div>REQUEST TO ORDER EXAM OF:	
</div><div>Plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan   
</div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
</div><div>&nbsp;Plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan alleges that in September of 2022, while plaintiff was lawfully on the property of defendant Trader Joe’s Company, a Trader Joe’s store in Glendale, plaintiff slipped and fell on an unknown liquid substance and as a result suffered bodily injuries and damages.  
</div><div>&nbsp;The form complaint alleges causes of action for premises liability and general negligence. 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:	
</div><div>Defendant Trader Joe’s Company seeks to compel plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan to comply with a Demand for IME that was originally set for April 16, 2024, but had to be rescheduled to June 12, 2024. 
</div><div>The opposition indicates that the motion is moot because plaintiff’s independent examination took place as scheduled on June 12, 2024. 
</div><div>The motion accordingly is denied with respect to the request for an order compelling compliance with the Demand for IME, as the motion is moot.  
</div><div>This posture leaves the issue of monetary sanctions, which are sought by both sides. 
</div><div>Defendant seeks sanctions under CCP section 2032.250 (b):
</div><div>“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney, who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel response and compliance with a demand for a physical examination, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
</div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436. 
</div><div>Defendant also seeks sanctions under CCP § 2023.010, pursuant to which misuse of the discovery process includes “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”   Where there has been misuse of the discovery process, under Section 2023.030(a), the court “may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  
</div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): 
</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant argues that plaintiff did not attend the IME that was set for April 16, 2024.  Specifically, defendant argues that plaintiff served an Objection to the Demand for IME, setting forth 19 conditions, none of which called for an interpreter to be present at the IME.  [Kim Decl., Ex. B]. 
</div><div>Defendant also indicates that plaintiff’s verified discovery responses to Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.9 and 2.10 confirmed that she can read, write and speak English with ease.  [Kim Decl., Ex. C]. 
</div><div>However, one day before the scheduled IME, on April 15, 2024, plaintiff notified defendant via email at 12:23 pm that plaintiff would require an Eastern Armenian interpreter at the IME on April 16, 2024.  [Kim Decl., Ex. D].   Though given short notice, defendant made available an Eastern Armenian interpreter via Zoom for plaintiff’s IME.  [Li Decl., para. 4, 5].  Defendant argues that plaintiff was instructed by her counsel not to attend the examination for lack of an in-person interpreter, even though plaintiff had traveled from Los Angeles to the doctor’s office in Newport Beach to attend the IME.  [Li Decl., paras. 6, 7]. 
</div><div>Defendant indicates that consequently, the doctor’s office charged a $600 no show fee, which plaintiff has refused to pay.  [Kim Decl., Exs. E, G].  
</div><div>Defendant also seeks $660 in sanctions for the cost of bringing the motion (3 hours at $200 per hour, plus $60 filing fee). 
</div><div>Plaintiff in opposition argues that defendant’s statement that plaintiff did not appear for her IME is a misrepresentation of facts.  Plaintiff argues that defendant was aware that although plaintiff represented in her discovery responses that she knows English, plaintiff prefers Armenian, and needed an interpreter for her deposition, but that knowing that plaintiff needed an interpreter, did not hire one for the IME.   [Ex. C].  Plaintiff indicates that plaintiff’s counsel was sure that defendant’s counsel would request an interpreter, but just to be safe, had her legal assistant email defense counsel to make sure the interpreter was requested.  
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that plaintiff appeared at her IME, with the nurse hired by plaintiff to be present at the IME, and that plaintiff’s counsel received a call that the interpreter was appearing via Zoom.   Plaintiff argues that given that many mistakes happen during Zoom translation, and it was a physical examination of plaintiff, with plaintiff, for example, being asked to point out body parts to the doctor, plaintiff’s counsel reasonably required an interpreter in person.  Defendant’s counsel asked if plaintiff would wait until they could find an interpreter willing to drive that far, and plaintiff’s counsel agreed, so plaintiff waited at the doctor’s office for almost an hour.  Plaintiff argues that although she waited patiently to get an interpreter to go forward with the IME, defense counsel was not able to get one.  It would have been helpful if this information had been included in a declaration, as the declaration submitted does not mention any of these facts, and the circumstances do not seem to be clearly reflected in the emails attached to the opposition, although there is an email from counsel for defendant which states: 
</div><div>“Even given this short notice, Defendant produced an interpreter via Zoom that was ready to proceed and assist on April 16, 2024. We discussed your reasons for preferring an in-person interpreter, where Defendant will happily provide an in-person interpreter for the rescheduled IME on June 12, 2024. At the same time, Defendant should not have to pay the cancellation fee for the April 16, 2024 IME because Plaintiff requested an interpreter less than 24 hours before the examination.” 
</div><div>[Darbinyan Decl., para. 3, Ex. H].  
</div><div>It appears that at that point, counsel for defendant found that the arguments made by plaintiff’s counsel why an in-person interpreter was necessary to be reasonable. 
</div><div>The opposition also argues that defendant has failed to address the fact that plaintiff served timely objections to the Notice of IME objecting to any responsibility for a cancellation fee.  Specifically, Plaintiff Lyudmila Petrosyan’s Objection and Response to Defendant’s Demand for Physical Examination indicates:
</div><div>“Plaintiff will comply with Defendants’ demand under the following further conditions…  17. Neither Plaintiff or counsel for Plaintiff will be responsible for any cancellation fees, if any, for rescheduling and/or cancelling any examinations set for by the noticing party as no such provision is authorized under the Code of Civil Procedure and is thus improper as a matter of law.” 
</div><div>[Darbinyan Decl., para. 3, Ex. D]. 
</div><div>This objection is not discussed either in the moving papers or the separate statement, when it is clearly highly relevant to the instant dispute.  The reply also does not respond to plaintiff’s argument or the fact that this objection is evidently outstanding.    
</div><div>This result is an unfortunate situation, as no formal request for an interpreter was made, and accommodations could not be made at the last minute, but it also appears that plaintiff did not deliberately fail to appear at the noticed IME, and it does not appear unreasonable to have required an in-person interpreter, which has since been provided in concession to the preferability for that situation.   The deposition has now been conducted.   Again, defendant has failed to address the objection made by plaintiff concerning the cancellation fee, either in the motion or separate statement, or in the reply.  
</div><div>Plaintiff in the opposition seeks sanctions for the cost of having the nurse appear twice ($700), as well as for the expense of opposing this motion in the sum of $1,050 (2 hours preparing opposition, 1 hour preparing for and appearing at hearing @ $350 per hour). [Darbinyan Decl., paras. 3, 4, Ex. G].  The argument is basically that defendant has unsuccessfully brought this motion, having failed to show how plaintiff failed to appear for her IME when she was at the doctor’s office for one hour waiting, with the nurse, for an interpreter to arrive.  The declaration in support of the motion does not refer to or confirm these facts.  [See Darbinyan Decl.]. 
</div><div>Hence, neither side has entirely prevailed on this motion or provided sufficient argument or evidence to the court justifying any shifting of the expenses in connection with this matter. 
</div><div>No sanctions are awarded.  
</div><div>RULING:
</div><div>Defendant Trader Joe’s Company’s Motion to Compel Compliance of is MOOT in light of the representation in the moving papers that the IME had been rescheduled and the confirmation in the opposition that the IME was conducted as rescheduled prior to the hearing on this motion.   
</div><div>Monetary sanctions, including cancellation fee, requested by moving party are DENIED. 
</div><div>Monetary sanctions requested in the opposition are DENIED. 
</div><div>Untimely and Unauthorized Supplemental Declaration in Support of the Opposition to Defendant Trader Joe’s Company’s Motion to Compel Compliance of IME is NOT CONSIDERED BY THE COURT.

</div><div>Case Name:	Keshishyan v. Aftandelian 
</div><div>MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED
</div><div>Moving Party: 	Plaintiff Arpik Keshishyan     
</div><div>Responding Party:	Defendant Sophia Aftandelian  (No Opposition) 
</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:
</div><div>Order that truth of all specified matters, and the genuineness of all specified documents in Requests for Admissions, Set One, be deemed admitted 
</div><div>CHRONOLOGY
</div><div>Date Discovery served:    		January 25, 2024, mail 
</div><div>Extensions to Respond to:		July 12, 2024 (without obj.)  
</div><div>Date Responses served: 		NO RESPONSES SERVED
</div><div>Date Motion served:  	 		July 15, 2024     Timely 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Under CCP § 2033.280 (a), a party who fails to serve a timely response to requests for admissions “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product….”   In addition, the requesting party may move for an order that “the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction....”   CCP § 2033.280(b).   The Code specifies that, “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  CCP § 2033.280(c).   
</div><div>In this case, requests for admissions were served to defendant on January 25, 2024.  Defendant requested extensions of time, which were granted, but defendant then failed to serve responses by the last requested extension on March 4, 2024.  [Abrahamian Decl., paras. 3, 4; Ex. C].   When no responses were served, counsel for plaintiff contacted defendant’s counsel and extended several extensions of time for defendant to respond to the discovery without objections. [Abrahamian Decl., paras. 4-9; Exs. C-H].  The last extension was to July 5, 2024. [Ex. H].  On July 9 and July 11, 2024, plaintiff emailed defendant’s counsel in an attempt to meet and confer regarding defendant’s failure to serve responses, and offered a further extension to July 12, 2024, but as of July 15, 2024, no responses had been provided.  [Abrahamian Decl., paras. 12, 13, Exs. I, J].  
</div><div>Defendant has failed to serve timely responses and has therefore waived all objections.  Plaintiff has filed a noticed motion requesting an order that the requests be deemed admitted as truth.  Unless satisfactory proposed responses are served before the hearing, the court must grant the motion.
</div><div>The court notes that the notice of motion seeks an order both that requests for admissions be deemed admitted and that the genuineness of documents be deemed admitted, but it does not appear that the set of Requests for Admissions submitted with the moving papers includes any requests concerning the genuineness of documents.  The motion will be granted deeming all matters specified in the Requests for Admissions admitted.   
</div><div>Sanctions
</div><div>Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions.  With respect to Requests for Admissions, CCP § 2033.280(c) provides:
</div><div>“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
</div><div>CCP § 2023.010 provides that misuses of the discovery process include:  “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where there has been such conduct, under CCP section 2023.030(a), “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct....If a monetary sanction is authorized” by the statute, “ the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that the other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” CCP § 2023.030(a).  
</div><div>In this case, the motion will be granted, defendant has failed to respond to an authorized method of discovery and plaintiff has submitted evidence that plaintiff has incurred expenses as a result of the conduct.  The imposition of sanctions is mandatory, and, moreover, the motion is unopposed, so there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Sanctions must be awarded.  Plaintiff requests $2,560, which seems a bit high for a motion of this nature at a $500 per hour billing rate.  One hour is sought to prepare a reply, when there is no opposition, so this time will be reduced.  Two hours are sought to travel to and appear at the hearing, when a remote appearance is an option.  The time will be reduced accordingly as follows: 3 total attorney hours at $500.00 per hour for a total of $1,500.00 in attorneys hours.     
</div><div>RULING:
</div><div>[No opposition]
</div><div>Plaintiff Arpik Keshishyan’s Motion for Order Deeming Admitted the Truth of Facts and Genuineness of Documents is GRANTED.   Defendant Sophia Aftandelian has failed to serve timely responses, or a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 prior to the hearing on this motion.  The Court therefore orders that all matters specified in Plaintiff Arpik Keshishyan’s Request for Admissions, Set One are deemed admitted as true, pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(c).  
</div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,500.00 (3.0 hours @ $500/hour) [5 hours requested] plus $60 in filing fees [Amount Requested $2,560], which sum is to be awarded in favor of plaintiff Arpik Keshishyan and against defendant Sophia Aftandelian, payable within 30 days.  CCP §§ 2033.280(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a).

</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED BY MOVING PARTY:
</div><div>Order compelling deposition of defendant General Motors LLC Persons Most Qualified, with production of documents
</div><div>FACTUAL BACKGROUND:
</div><div>Plaintiffs Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta allege that in February of 2021 plaintiff purchased a Chevrolet Trailblazer RS, which was warranted by defendant General Motors LLC (GM), with defendant providing an express warranty and an implied warranty, including an implied warranty of fitness.   
</div><div>Plaintiffs allege that the vehicle has suffered from nonconformity to warranties, including no start, water leak, brake system control module, park assist indicator light, brake system and other defects. 
</div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that the defects and nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves within the applicable warranty periods.  Plaintiffs allege that plaintiffs delivered the vehicle to defendant’s authorized facilities for repair of these nonconformities on numerous occasions, but that defendant has been unable or has refused to conform the subject vehicle to the applicable warranties after a reasonable number of attempts.  
</div><div>Plaintiffs allege that notwithstanding plaintiffs’ entitlement to a repurchase under the Act and defendant’s knowledge of that entitlement through its internal repair, customer service, and warranty records, defendant has intentionally refused to comply with its obligations under the Act to repurchase the subject vehicle and make restitution. 
</div><div>The complaint alleges a cause of action for Restitution and Damages. 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Plaintiffs seek an order compelling defendant GM to produce its Person Most Qualified to appear and testify at a deposition and produce documents requested in the deposition notice. 
</div><div>The moving papers show that plaintiffs have served defendant with a series of deposition notices, beginning on April 8, 2024, and that defendant GM served written objections to the original notice, the First Amended Notice and the Second Amended Notice.  [Sanchez Decl., paras. 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12; Exs. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8].   
</div><div>Plaintiffs indicate that despite numerous meet and confer efforts, defendant GM has not responded and has not proposed any potential dates for the deposition. [Sanchez Decl., para. 20].  
</div><div>The motion includes a meet and confer letter sent on June 7, 2024, requesting dates for the deposition, to which it was evidently not responded.  [Sanchez Decl., para. 20, Ex. 9].
</div><div>This motion was filed and served on July 1, 2024, and evidently no deposition dates have been provided by defendant.   
</div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:
</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party..., without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”
</div><div>Under CCP section 2025.230, with respect to the deposition of the person most knowledgeable: 
</div><div>“If the deponent named is not a natural person, the deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is requested.  In that event the deponent shall designate and produce at deposition those of its officers, directors, managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably available to the deponent.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The moving papers sufficiently establish that defendant, a party to the action, for its person most qualified to testify, was served with deposition notices, and that the objections to those notices objected to the selected deposition dates, but defendant has failed since April of 2024 to provide mutually agreeable dates for the deposition, or to respond to reasonable meet and confer efforts, and have failed to appear for examinations as noticed.  [Sanchez Decl., paras. 5-13, 20].  Plaintiffs accordingly are entitled to an order compelling defendant’s attendance and testimony. 
</div><div>&nbsp;The motion also seeks that the court order the deponent to provide document production along with the deposition testimony. 
</div><div>&nbsp;Under CCP § 2025.450 (b):
</div><div>“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
</div><div>(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
</div><div>(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The memorandum argues that there is good cause for production of the requested documents because they go to the essential elements of plaintiffs’ express and implied warranty and damages claim.  Plaintiff argues that the document requests are straightforward, relevant to the claims in the case, are not overbroad in scope, and are not privileged or otherwise protected.  Plaintiffs argue that the information sought is universally discoverable in lemon law cases, and the requests are consistent with this court’s pertinent standing order. The requests seek documents pertaining to the subject vehicle, and other documents which appear pertinent to the lawsuit.  
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant in the opposition argues that this motion was not necessary as GM has already produced documents directly responsive to plaintiffs’ discovery requests and has agreed to produce a witness to testify about relevant topics concerning plaintiffs’ vehicle and will provide dates and produce documents at any PMQ deposition.  It is not clear why defendant has not done so in the many months before this motion was filed, and in the time before opposition to the motion was due.  The motion accordingly is granted.  The deposition and production of documents also is ordered as requested.  Any argument that documents have already been produced is rejected by the court, as plaintiffs are entitled to documents responsive to the current form of discovery.   
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant also argues, despite its protestations of willingness to fulfill its discovery obligations, that plaintiff has failed to set forth specific fact showing good cause justifying their discovery requests.  As discussed above, sufficient good cause has been established by the moving papers.  Defendant also seems to argue, without citation to legal authority, that discovery in this matter should not include defendant’s policies and procedures.  Discovery in this matter is not so limited.  
</div><div>&nbsp;In addition, as recognized in the moving papers, this matter is subject to the Addendum to Case Management Conference Order (Song-Beverly Litigation) (Order) applicable to Song-Beverly Litigation, now posted and available on the Los Angeles Superior Court website in connection with this Department, Glendale Courthouse, Department D.   The Order was signed and entered by the Court on January 24, 2023 and was revised, signed and entered on January 11, 2024
</div><div>Pursuant to that Order, “any formal discovery propounded and currently pending or outstanding by a party in this matter prior to the date of this CMC Order is stayed pending further order of the Court.”
</div><div>[Order section (1)(a)]. 
</div><div>The Order sets forth the following provision concerning discovery in Song-Beverly matters which appear to address the discovery disputes raised by the current motion. With respect to depositions, the Order provides:
</div><div>4.	Deposition:  Within the time limits allowed by law.  Defendant may depose plaintiff, and plaintiff may depose the person most knowledgeable (PMK) as to up to 5 categories of information, plus a deposition of the PMK as to why the subject vehicle was not repurchased, in addition to depositions of any experts identified by the parties, after a formal demand and exchange of expert witness information, per CCP § 2034.  Parties shall meet and confer as to whether there is a need to take any additional depositions.  Any additional depositions may only be noticed and taken by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
</div><div>If a deponent resides out of state, the deposition may be taken by video conference or telephone.  The parties will not be required to travel to California, and the attorneys will not be required to travel out of state.”
</div><div>[Order, section 4], emphasis added. 
</div><div>&nbsp;With respect to document production, the order provides:
</div><div>“Production of Documents:  Within 60 days of service of this Order both plaintiff and defendant shall provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side(s):
</div><div>a.	Purchase or lease contracts concerning the subject vehicle, including any associated documents reflecting OEM or aftermarket equipment installed at the dealership, ELWs or service contracts, and any other writings signed by the plaintiff at the point of sale.
</div><div>b.	Work orders, repair orders, and invoices (including accounting and warranty versions) for any maintenance, service and repair activity concerning the subject vehicles.
</div><div>c.	Rental car or loaner agreements regarding alternative transportation provided during service or repair visits concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>d.	Records of communications with dealer personnel, and/or factory representatives and defendant’s call center or customer assistance personnel concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>e.	Warrant claims submitted to and/or approved by defendant concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>f.	Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual or similar policies or claim-handling procedures published by Defendant from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>g.	Defendant’s written statements of policy and/or procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase or replacement pursuant to “Lemon Law” claims, including ones brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the date the subject vehicle was purchased or leased to the date the lawsuit was filed.
</div><div>h.	A list of or compilation of customer complaints in defendant’s electronically stored information database that are substantially similar to the alleged defects claimed by plaintiff, in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.  A substantially similar customer complaint would be the same nature of reported symptom, malfunction, dashboard indicator light, or other manifestation of a repair problem as the description listed in any work order or repair order for the subject vehicle, other than routine or scheduled maintenance items.  The list provided by defendant may be in the chart or spreadsheet format, and shall include the VIN, date of repair visit, dealership or other reporting location, and text of the other customers’ reported complaint, but shall not include the other customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personal identifying information.
</div><div>i.	Technical Service Bulletins and Recall Notices for vehicle purchased or leased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle.
</div><div>j.	Copies of any repair instruction, bulletin, or other diagnostic/repair procedure identified in any of the repair order/invoice records for the subject vehicle.
</div><div>k.	Receipts or other written evidence supporting any incidental or consequential damages claimed by plaintiff.
</div><div>If a party believes any of this information should be subject to a protective order, that party shall serve and file a proposed protective order within 5 days of this Order and the parties shall meet and confer as to agreeable language for the same.  The default will be the standard Protective Order provided by the LASC in its website.
</div><div>The information may be provided to the opposing party in electronic form as a PDF at the option of the producing party.
</div><div>Plaintiff and defendant shall serve verification with the documents they produce.
</div><div>Any additional requests for documents may only be propounded by stipulation and/or court order (via motion upon showing of good cause).
</div><div>[Order section (2)(a)].
</div><div>The parties are also directed to the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, entitled Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation) (Notice).  That Notice provides:
</div><div>“When the court is faced with a discovery dispute in a Song-Beverly case, the court will usually order that the plaintiff and defendant provide copies of the following documents, which are in their respective possession, custody and/or control, to the opposing side: 
</div><div>1. Defendant shall produce the “Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual” published by Defendant and provided to its authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>2. Defendant shall produce any internal analysis or investigation regarding defects alleged in plaintiff's complaint in vehicles for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. This includes Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins. Defendant is not required to do a search of emails. 
</div><div>3. Defendant shall produce any customer complaints relating to defects alleged in plaintiff’s complaint in vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>4. Defendant shall produce all documents evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for the period of [date of purchase] to present. 
</div><div>5. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>6. Communications with dealer, factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject vehicle.
</div><div>7. Warranty claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>8. Purchase and/or lease contract concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>9. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle. 
</div><div>10. Any documents supporting plaintiff’s claim for incidental and/or consequential damages.”
</div><div>&nbsp;The court notes that the Order provides for PMK depositions for up to 5 categories of information, plus a deposition of the PMK as to why the subject vehicle was not repurchased.  The Second Amended Notice of Deposition designates seven matters on which the PMQ is to be examined, but two of them appear to be directed to the repurchase or replacement issue.  [See Ex. 7, Ex. A, Matters Nos. 1, 6.  The court finds this showing in conformity with the Order.  Therefore, the defendant is ordered to appear and testify as noticed. 
</div><div>With respect to the documents requested, the production is to be made and the deposition conducted in accordance with the Order and Notice.  If there is some further dispute concerning the production of documents or the conduct of the deposition, the parties must comply with the Order and Notice, and meet and confer in good faith concerning any outstanding discovery in light of the Order and Notice, and, if necessary, pursue a further motion which must be accompanied by a separate statement reflecting the then current status of any discovery disputes, including in that separate statement as to each request and response any applicable language of the Order and Notice. 
</div><div>Defendant also appears to argue that plaintiff’s discovery here implicates trade secret and propriety information of GM.  The court finds this argument spurious, as the court notes that the file in this matter shows that before the filing of the motion to compel, and before the assertion of this argument in the  opposition, the parties filed a Stipulation and Protective Order—Confidential Designation Only, which was signed by the parties, and then signed by the court and filed as its order on June 3, 2024.  This protective order eliminates any general objection that trade secret or proprietary or confidential information is being sought.  The motion is granted. 
</div><div>Sanctions
</div><div>This leaves the issue of monetary sanctions, which are sought by the moving parties.   
</div><div>Plaintiffs request monetary sanctions for the expense of having to bring this motion. 
</div><div>Under CCP § 2025.450 (g)(1):
</div><div>“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
</div><div>CCP § 2023.010 (d) provides that misuse of the discovery process includes, “Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”   CCP § 2023.030(a) authorizes the imposition of monetary sanctions against a party and its attorney for misuse of the discovery process.  
</div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a): 
</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
</div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.  Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  
</div><div>&nbsp;Here, the motion is granted under CCP § 2025.450 subdivision (a).  This statute indicates that the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction.  
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant has failed to show how defendant was substantially justified in delaying many months in providing a date for the PMQ deposition, and in failing to meet and confer to comply with the court’s Order.  Defendant in opposition argues that the request for sanctions is groundless, as plaintiffs’ motion is baseless, which it clearly is not, because it is being granted.  Defendant also argues that GM has agreed to provide a PMQ deposition, and it is simply a matter of working with the witness to provide dates.  There is no explanation why this task could not have been completed in the many months since the deposition was first noticed in April of 2024, which would have avoided the need to bring this motion.  Sanctions are awarded.  
</div><div>The sanctions sought by plaintiffs are $3,000.00.  These appear reasonable and are awarded in full as requested. 
</div><div>RULING:
</div><div>Plaintiffs Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Person Most Qualified, with Production of Documents is GRANTED. 
</div><div>Defendant General Motors LLC is ordered to designate and produce witness(es) to appear for deposition and to give testimony on a mutually convenient date and time as to the matters requested in Plaintiffs Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta’s Second Amended Notice of Deposition of Defendant General Motors, LLC’s Person(s) Most Qualified, with Production of Documents served on May 21, 2024, no later than October 4, 2024. Good cause appearing, the deponent(s) is (are) also ordered to produce for inspection at the deposition any and all materials described in the subject notice which are consistent with this Court’s Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation), signed and entered by the Court on January 24, 2023 as revised, signed and entered on January 11, 2024, as well as materials which are consistent with this Court’s Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D, Customary Rulings Re Document Requests (Song Beverly Litigation). 
</div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party: Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $3,000.00 (8.0 hours @ $375 per hour) [8 hours requested] [Amount Requested $3,000], which sum is to be awarded in favor of plaintiffs Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta and against defendant General Motors LLC, payable within 30 days.  CCP §§ 2025.450 (g)(1), 2023.010 (d) and 2023.030 (a). 
</div><div>Plaintiffs Jesus Argueta and Daisy Argueta’s Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Cameron Major are NOT RULED UPON BY THE COURT, as the subject declaration testimony is irrelevant to the Court’s determination of this motion.

</div><div>DEMURRER TO ANSWER
</div><div>Moving Party:            	Plaintiff Cheryl L. Raner       
</div><div>Responding Party:	Defendant John K. Stumpus       
</div><div>RELIEF REQUESTED:	
</div><div>&nbsp; Sustain demurrer to verified answer
</div><div>SUMMARY OF FACTS:
</div><div>&nbsp;Plaintiff Cheryl L. Raner brings this case for partition of real property, an apartment building in Pasadena, alleging that plaintiff is the owner of an undivided one-fourth (25%) tenant-in-common interests in the property, and that defendant John K. Stumpus is an owner of an undivided three-fourths (75%) tenant-in-common interest in the property.  Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff and defendant are cousins who acquired their interests in the property through common relatives, and that after defendant acquired interest in the property, plaintiff entrusted him with management of the property.  
</div><div>The verified complaint alleges that defendant has failed to properly manage the property, failing to collect rents at fair market value for several units and neglecting to accurately record the property’s income and expenses, and not providing information on accounting related to the property to plaintiff.  
</div><div>Plaintiff alleges that the parties do not communicate well and have been unable to reach an agreement to divide the property, leaving plaintiff with no option other than to undertake this action for the parties’ common benefit. 
</div><div>The complaint alleges one cause of action for partition, and seeks allowance, accounting, contribution or any compensatory adjustments among the parties according to equity, an interlocutory judgment, appointment of a partition referee and receiver, an order of disbursement, a writ of possession, and attorneys’ fees and experts’ and referees’ expenses. 
</div><div>Defendant Stumpus, individually and as successor trustee of the Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust, has filed a verified answer to the complaint, responding to each paragraph of the complaint, and alleging thirteen affirmative defenses. 
</div><div>ANALYSIS:
</div><div>Under CCP section 430.30, an objection may be taken by demurrer to a pleading, “[w]hen any ground for objection to” an “answer appears on the face thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial notice…”
</div><div>CCP section 430.20 provides:
</div><div>“A party against whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer as provided in Section 430.30, to the answer upon any one or more of the following grounds:
</div><div>(a)	The answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense.
</div><div>(b)	The answer is uncertain.  As used in this subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
</div><div>(c)	Where the answer pleads a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the answer whether the contract is written or oral.”
</div><div>Plaintiff Raner initially argues that in a partition action, the law requires that the defendant specifically allege the status of defendant’s interest in the property, but defendant has failed to do so.  
</div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 872.410, which provides, in pertinent part, with respect for civil actions for partition of real and personal property: 
</div><div>“The answer shall set forth:
</div><div>(a)	Any interest the defendant has or claims in the property.” 
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that defendant is required to set up in his own pleading the nature and extent of his interest in the property, and that an allegation that plaintiff and defendant are owners of the property fails to state the proportionate interest being claimed by defendant. 
</div><div>Defendant in opposition argues that the answer sufficiently alleges defendant’s position that plaintiff no longer holds any interest in the property, as in paragraph 4 of the answer, defendant alleges that “title is vested in the trustee to the Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust U/D/T Dated September 10, 2007 (see Exhibit E to the Verified Partition Complaint).”  [Answer, para. 4].  
</div><div>Defendant argues that a review of that document, Exhibit E to the Complaint, which supersedes any allegations of the complaint to which it is attached to the extent the allegations are inconsistent, shows that title is in fact held in that matter.  The document is a Guarantee of Condition of Title issued by First American Title on March 8, 2024, and states:
</div><div>“According to the Public Records as of the Date of Guarantee, 
</div><div>a.  Title to the estate or interest in the Land is vested in: 
</div><div>Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus, as Trustees of The Achilles Stumpus and Geraldine Miller Stumpus Family Trust, U/D/T Dated September 10, 2007, Subject to Exception No. 5.”
</div><div>[Complaint, Ex. E]. 
</div><div>&nbsp;Exception 5 refers to “The effect of a document entitled ‘AFFIDAVIT-DEATH OF TRUSTEES,” recorded July 7, 2021…”  [Id.]
</div><div>&nbsp;The answer accordingly is sufficient to allege that defendant is alleging that the trust is the 100% owner of the property, with plaintiff having no interest at all.   The demurrer on this ground is overruled. 
</div><div>Plaintiff also argues that since the legislature removed all defenses to a partition complaint other than waiver, the fourth through fifteenth affirmative defenses are invalid as a matter of law. 
</div><div>Plaintiff relies on CCP section 872.710 (b), which provides:
</div><div>“Except as provided in Section 872.730, partition as to concurrent interests in the property shall be as of right unless barred by a valid waiver.”    
</div><div>&nbsp;CCP section 872.730 applies to proceedings involving partnerships, which is not at issue here. 
</div><div>Plaintiff relies on LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 484, in which the court of appeal observed, “A co-owner of property has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid waiver.”   LEG Investments, at 493.  
</div><div>However, as noted above, defendant here is taking the position that plaintiff is not a co-owner of the property, so that the right to partition is in issue here. 
</div><div>In addition, Miller and Starr recognize that:
</div><div>“Partition is a matter of absolute right and in the absence of waiver or estoppel or other equitable defenses, each co-tenant in ownership has the right to petition for partition of the common property.”
</div><div>Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.)  § 40:126, emphasis added. 
</div><div>There is also a discussion in Miller &amp; Starr with respect to defenses to partition, in which it is observed:
</div><div>“Equitable defenses. The element of unfairness that precludes an absolute right of partition under various circumstances often results from the fact that a court ordered sale of the property in a partition action is a sale of the entire interest in the property and not merely a sale of the individual interests of the co-owners. The sale becomes a “forced sale” in the same sense as a foreclosure sale or a sale under execution. The objecting co-owner is thereby required to part with his or her interest in the property contrary to his or her expectations. Because an action for partition is an equitable proceeding, this hardship on the defendant cotenant has induced the courts to modify the absolute right of partition by certain equitable defenses such as waiver of the right of partition, estoppel, or other conditions that make the equitable principle of fairness applicable.
</div><div>Unfairness as a defense to partition. “[I]n addition to the limitation on the right of partition derived from the express or implied waiver by agreement, the courts have imposed an even wider and more general limitation. This limitation subjects the right of partition to the ‘requirements of fairness.’”
</div><div>Miller and Starr, California Real Estate (4th Ed.)  § 11:20, footnotes omitted, italics in the original, quoting American Medical International, Inc. v. Feller (1976) 59 Cal. App. 3d 1008, 1015. 
</div><div>&nbsp;Defendant in opposition also points out that the cause of action for partition as alleged in the verified complaint seeks various equitable remedies, such as an accounting, which claims would fairly be subject to equitable defenses.  [Complaint, prayer, paras. A-E].  
</div><div>The demurrer on this ground is overruled. 
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that the first cause of action for failure to state a cause of action affirmative defense is inadequate as a matter of a law, as it is merely a general denial, which is prohibited in response to a verified complaint. 
</div><div>It appears that under California statutory law, this is a valid objection to a pleading.  As defendant points out in the opposition, under CCP Section 430.80, the defense is expressly designated a valid objection which cannot be waived even if a party fails to timely assert it:
</div><div>“(b) If the party against whom an answer has been filed fails to demur thereto, that party is deemed to have waived the objection unless it is an objection that the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense.”
</div><div>Since this defense cannot be waived even if not asserted, it evidently can be asserted in an answer, and need not be alleged with any particularity.  In Stevens v. Torregano (1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 105, the court of appeal expressly observed:
</div><div>“[T]he point that a complaint does not state a cause of action is never waived.  The point may be raised by answer, and it is not improper to do so, even though a previous demurer on the same ground has been overruled.”
</div><div>Stevens, at 112, citations omitted. 
</div><div>The demurrer on this ground is overruled. 
</div><div>Plaintiff argues that the first affirmative defense and the fourth through twelfth affirmative defenses, which are equitable defenses, are not sufficiently specifically pled.  
</div><div>Plaintiff relies on FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1993) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, in which the court of appeal affirmed the granting of a motion for summary judgment, in part on the ground that the conclusory affirmative defenses stated in defendants’ answer were insufficient to place facts in issue. 
</div><div>“All of the allegations are proffered in the form of terse 
</div><div>legal conclusions, rather than as facts "averred as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and are alleged in the complaint." (See Pomeroy, Code Remedies, supra, at 563, at p. 917.) The only affirmative defenses that are mentioned in the summary judgment proceedings, fraud in the inducement and failure of consideration, are not well pled, consisting of legal conclusions, and would not have survived a demurrer. (See e.g.,   Metropolis etc. Sav. Bank v. Monnier (1915) 169 Cal. 592, 596 [147 P. 265] (Metropolis); Riegel v. Wollenshlager (1920) 49 Cal.App. 300, 301 302 [193 P. 160].)”
</div><div>FPI, at 384.
</div><div>&nbsp;The argument here is that each affirmative defense must be alleged with particularity of facts and specifically allege each element in the answer.  A review of the answer here shows that this situation is not the usual case where the affirmative defenses consist primarily of a recitation of the defense, without providing details.  Each affirmative defense is supported by detailed factual allegations.  [Answer, pp. 6-14].  While the reply again argues that these defenses must be alleged with particularity, it would appear that this is not a situation where a review of the answer itself shows a lack of detail. 
</div><div>These defenses, particularly when considered in connection with the allegations and exhibits to the complaint, are sufficient to provide plaintiff notice of what is being alleged.  In addition, this court does not find this specificity argument under FPI Development  persuasive, because the case stands for the generic proposition that mere allegations in a pleading are insufficient to withstand summary judgment.  It does not stand for the proposition of a heightened pleading standard for affirmative defenses in an answer.  The case does not make any reference to CCP sections 430.20 or 430.30.  
</div><div>&nbsp;In fact, it is recognized that plaintiffs rarely demur to answers, even though they have such a right pursuant to CCP § 430.30(a). See Weil &amp; Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group, 2024 rev.) para.  6:476.  The practice is disfavored due to the notice-based aspects of pleadings.  South Shore Land Co. v. Peterson (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.  
</div><div>&nbsp;Sufficient notice with respect to each affirmative defense has been provided here. The demurrer on this ground is overruled. 
</div><div>&nbsp;The demurrer accordingly is overruled in its entirety. 
</div><div>RULING:
</div><div>Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant’s Answer is OVERRULED. 
</div><div>Objection to Late Reply to Opposition to Demurrer to Answer is OVERRULED in light of the continuance of the hearing date, which has permitted defendant sufficient time to review the untimely reply and prepare for oral argument in response to it. 
</div><div>The Court in its discretion has considered the late filed reply, filed and served only three court days before the date originally set for hearing, rather than the five court days required under CCP section 1005(b).  See CRC Rule Rule 3.1300(d)
