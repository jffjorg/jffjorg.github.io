The Court will address the issue of sanctions on Defendants’ motion in connection with the continued hearing on May 17, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.”</div><div><br></div><div>Supplemental briefs have been filed and considered by the court.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="white-space: pre; white-space: normal;">	</span></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Markarian</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>As noted above, this matter has been continued only on the issue of monetary sanctions, which the court had previously been prepared to award to moving parties in the sum of $4,574.00 against plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The previous tentative had been to deny sanctions sought by plaintiff in the opposition.&nbsp; The supplemental opposition repeats the arguments made in the moving papers and is based on an assumption that the motion to compel the deposition was unsuccessfully made because it had been rendered moot, which is not correct, as the court understands now that the motion was not entirely moot, and even had it been moot, it was not unsuccessfully brought.&nbsp; Plaintiff also argues again that the motion was brought despite the fact that the parties were in the process of meeting and conferring when it was brought, as previously argued.&nbsp; It appears that plaintiff was at all times standing by his position that the deposition could not take place until a date month in the future, and the parties had reached an impasse on that issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Monetary sanctions requested by plaintiff in the opposition are denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>With respect to the monetary sanctions sought by defendants, defendants in the moving papers seek a total of $15,939.&nbsp; The $4,547.00 which the court was prepared to award represented the reasonable costs which had been incurred by defendants in connection with the non-appearance by plaintiff at a deposition in December, which plaintiff’s counsel has conceded was not properly calendared by counsel.&nbsp; The sanctions sought for the non-appearance include a videographer fee of $525, a court reporter fee of $1,074, and 5 hours to travel to and attend the deposition at $595 per hour ($2,975), for the $4,574 total which the court awards.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Plaintiff in the opposition indicates that plaintiff has already tendered the amount of $2,194 to cover Defendant’s costs arising from the mis-calendared December 21, 2023 deposition date, arguing that this amount covers defendant’s costs for the court reporter and videographer, plus one hour of Mr. Vivoli’s time at his stated billable rate. This does not include the four hours of travel time sought, and plaintiff argues that counsel always had the more cost-effective option of conducting the deposition via remote video conferencing but elected to travel from San Diego for no legitimate reason.&nbsp; The court finds that the travel time to the deposition was not unreasonable under the circumstances, and that in a proceeding as significant as the deposition of the plaintiff in this case, counsel reasonably chose to personally appear to assess the witness.&nbsp; The court awards the full sum sought of $4,574.&nbsp; If payment has been made of some portion of the award, that sum may be offset against the total when payment is being made.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>The court had previously been reluctant to award the sanctions sought for the preparation of the motion to compel, based on representations in the opposition that defendants had filed the motion while plaintiff’s counsel was under the impression that the parties would continue their efforts to resolve the scheduling issue informally, and on representations that the motion was in fact moot because the deposition had been conducted, completed, and all documents had been produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As noted above, after the previous hearing, the court entered an order ordering the deponent to be made available for a further deposition and to produce all documents responsive to the deposition notice, so that the motion to compel has now been granted on its merits.&nbsp; That order remains the order of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The order was made pursuant to CCP § 2025.450 (a), which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div>The moving papers sufficiently establish here that plaintiff, a party to the action, was served with a deposition notice, did not serve an objection, and failed to appear for his examination which had been noticed on a date offered by plaintiff’s counsel as available. [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7-13, Exs. B, C, D].&nbsp; Defendants’ counsel contacted plaintiff’s counsel, who claimed that they knew nothing of the scheduled deposition that day, but then later acknowledged responsibility for having failed to attend the deposition.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶¶ 11-13, Ex. D].&nbsp; The supplemental opposition also indicates that sanctions have in fact already been paid to acknowledge this situation.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants are accordingly entitled to an order compelling plaintiff’s attendance and testimony, which order has now been entered.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The moving papers also sufficiently establish good cause for the production of the documents sought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2025.450 (b), with respect to document production, subdivision (1) requires, “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in the moving papers argue that there is good cause to compel plaintiff to produce the requested documents, as the documents are all directly relevant or at least reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, as defendant Yerushalmi has steadfastly denied making the calls attributed to him.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶ 17].&nbsp; Defendants also indicate that the defendants have sought to obtain documents in connection with phone records by subpoena from the third parties insurer and insurance broker that claimed Yerushalmi called them.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶ 18].&nbsp; Plaintiffs filed a motion to quash those subpoenas, which the court granted, in part, on grounds defendants should first seek such documents from plaintiffs directly.&nbsp; [Vivoli Decl. ¶ 18].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The file shows that on November 18, 2022, the court heard motion to quash deposition subpoenas for business records served on Nationwide Insurance Company and Town &amp; Country Financial Insurance Group.&nbsp; The motion was denied in part and granted in part, on the ground that plaintiffs had established an objectively reasonably expectation of privacy in their insurance information, and that defendants had failed to establish a countervailing interest, “that is, that the subject information, as sought, is discoverable in the context of this lawsuit, or has been sought through less intrusive means.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 11/18/2023, p. 16].&nbsp; The court in its minute order had also observed that it had not been established with respect to some documents that the information sought, including information concerning the relationship between plaintiff Markarian and plaintiff New Look spa, “could not be obtained through less intrusive means, such as by first directing discovery concerning such an issue to plaintiffs.”&nbsp; [Minute Order 11/18/2023, p. 13].</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>It appears from a review of the most recent deposition notice, attached as Exhibit C to the Vivoli Declaration, that the documents requested are those which relate to the relationship between the plaintiffs, records of phone calls from September 1, 2020 through September 5, 2020, communications between the parties and with the insurer and insurance broker, documents supporting the&nbsp; contentions and allegations of plaintiff’s complaint, and documents evidencing any claimed damages. [Vivoli Decl., Ex. C].&nbsp; The requests appear to seek discoverable information, including information this court has essentially suggested being sought directly from plaintiff. As noted above, plaintiff has failed to serve written objections to the deposition notice or any aspect of it, so has failed to raise or establish any valid objection to production of responsive documents at the deposition. The court accordingly finds good cause to grant the order compelling production of responsive documents as well.&nbsp; The court has entered such an order, which will remain the order of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The supplemental brief argues that due to these orders entered under subdivision (a), monetary sanctions for the preparation of the motion to compel are mandatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2025.450 (g)(1):</div><div>“If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2023.010 (d) provides that misuse of the discovery process includes, “Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”&nbsp; &nbsp;CCP § 2023.030(a) authorizes the imposition of monetary sanctions against a party and its attorney for misuse of the discovery process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CRC Rule 3.1348(a):&nbsp;</div><div>“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”</div><div><br></div><div>The burden is on the party subject to sanctions to show substantial justification or injustice.&nbsp; Mattco Forge, Inc. v.

(1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The supplemental brief indicates that contrary to representations at the hearing, the deposition of plaintiff had not been completed as of the time of the hearing, and all documents had not been produced at that deposition, and presents a deposition transcript confirming that the deposition concluded, with defendants’ counsel stating, “Subject to the documents that I need to meet and confer with counsel about, I think I am done at this point.”&nbsp; [Supp. Vivoli Decl.

Q, Depo. transcript, pp. 40, 77].</div><div><br></div><div>The argument is that the motion was not moot at the time of the hearing, and the orders concerning the deposition and documents were proper and necessary.&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears that since the hearing, a second deposition has been conducted, and that it has now been discovered that Markarian is unable to produce his cellular records, as they are too far back and can no longer be accessed, although they were requested last July.&nbsp; Defendants will have to subpoena the cellular phone provider to produce those records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the issue regarding the sum of monetary sanctions to be awarded, which is the only issue remaining to be heard on this motion, the court will award the nonappearance sanctions it had previously tentatively awarded, as well as a reasonable sum for the preparation of the motion which was necessitated by plaintiff’s conduct with respect to delaying in setting the deposition, and only offering dates far into the future, until this motion was filed.&nbsp; Plaintiff has not established that awarding sanctions would be unjust or that the conduct necessitating the motion was substantially justified under the circumstances.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The sanctions sought in the moving papers are $15,939.&nbsp; As set forth above, the sanctions sought for the non-appearance include a videographer fee of $525, a court reporter fee of $1,074, and 5 hours to travel to and attend the deposition at $595 per hour ($2,975), for the $4,574 total which the court will award.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the remaining sanctions sought, the moving papers seek 9 hours preparing the motion, 5 hours reviewing opposition and preparing reply and 1 hour attending the hearing (15 hours) at $595/hour, for a total of $8,925, plus $60 in filing fees.&nbsp; (The total sanctions sought are $15,939, but the sum supported by the declaration totals $13,559.&nbsp; The discrepancy is evidently based on a potential additional 4 hours to be charged if the hearing was attended personally.&nbsp; The minute order reflects attendance was by LA CourtConnect, not a personal appearance.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These fees appear very high for a motion of this nature, which requires a straightforward showing that deposition notice was served, was not complied with, and that there is good cause for ordering production of the requested documents.&nbsp; The hours spent are adjusted to a reasonable number of hours for this type of motion as follows: 4.0 hours preparing the motion; 2.0 hours preparing the reply; 1.0 hour attorney time to attend the hearing for total attorney time for a total of $4,165.00.</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants in the supplemental brief seek additional sanctions in the sum of $7,619.&nbsp; &nbsp;The declaration seeks fees for the fees for attending the February 2024 deposition and the April 26, 2024 deposition, for what appears to be a total of $595 plus $2,975 claimed ($3,570).&nbsp; [Supp. Vivoli Decl. ¶ 9].&nbsp; The supplemental brief also seeks 5 hours for drafting the supplemental brief at $595 per hour ($2,975) and 5 hours of time, with travel, to and from the court to personally attend the hearing, for an additional $2,975.&nbsp; &nbsp;This totals $9,520, but the declaration total of $7,619 is evidently based on the assumption the court will only permit one hour of time for appearance at the hearing, which would be $2,975 plus $595 for a subtotal of $3,570.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No sanctions will be awarded for the expense of attending depositions, as it would appear that at least some useful information was obtained at those depositions, particularly given the transcript reflecting that there was an intent to convene additional depositions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With respect to the fees sought to prepare the supplemental papers, the court will award reasonable additional fees.&nbsp; Again, the fees sought appear high for a supplemental pleading of this nature.&nbsp; The hours will be adjusted to reflect a reasonable number of hours to prepare the supplemental papers, which, given the entry of the order for the deponent to appear and produce documents, were meant to address the fairly narrow issues of monetary sanctions.&nbsp; The court is also concerned that travel time from San Diego to attend the hearing personally does not appear to be a charge reasonably shifted to plaintiff in this circumstance, which is apparently recognized by the moving party.&nbsp; The supplemental opposition does not challenge any of the fees sought in the supplemental brief, or their amounts.&nbsp; However, the court also has other concerns with respect to the reasonableness of the additional fees sought.&nbsp; The fees for filing the supplemental pleading be awarded but are adjusted accordingly as follows: 3.0 hours attorney time drafting the supplemental brief at $595.00 per hour and one hour attorney time to attend the hearing virtually for total of 4.0 hours attorney time at $595.00 per hour for a total of $2,380.00 in attorneys’ fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yerushalmi</div><div>Plaintiffs New Look Skin Center, Inc. and Albert Markarian have filed an unopposed motion to compel the deposition of defendant David Yerushalmi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The moving papers establish that defendant Yerushalmi, a party to the action, was served with a Notice of Taking Deposition on February 23, 2024, for a deposition to be conducted on March 11, 2024.&nbsp;

Defendant Mouradian represented that she was an expert and well-informed on operating a rehabilitation business and suggested that they work together to establish such a business.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff agreed to explore the idea, and approached two childhood friends, defendant Norbeh Aboolian and defendant Fred Akopyan, concerning investing in the business.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In July of 2020, the parties agreed, and all signed an agreement that each of them was the owner of 25% of the new business venture.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that he initially invested sums totaling $35,000 in the business, and in place of further cash contribution paid defendant Mouradian’s personal expenses for six to eight months, at approximately $4,000 to $5,000 per month.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendant Mouradian did not contribute or invest any funds toward the new business venture but represented that her know-how of the business would substitute for her contribution in the new business.</div><div><br></div><div>The parties located premises for the business and filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State on December 8, 2020 for the business Hillcrest Recovery, Inc., which business was named Hollywood Hills Recovery.&nbsp; Plaintiff and defendant Mouradian commenced fixing the physical location of the business, and obtained the necessary licenses, and the new business began functioning as an inpatient rehabilitation center.&nbsp; Plaintiff and defendant Mouradian physically worked at the new business, but defendants Aboolian and Akopyan did not, but continued to be engaged in their own trucking business.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that the parties proceeded to hire staff, and begin promoting the business, and from July 2021 through July 2022, plaintiff attracted many patients to the business and the business received large sums of monies from insurance companies and patients, which plaintiff alleges are still maintained in the business bank accounts, for which plaintiff requires an accounting.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is also alleged that in June of 2021, plaintiff and defendants established an outpatient recovery center, bringing in defendant Phillip (“Chill”) Aguilar, who was knowledgeable about outpatient recovery systems.&nbsp; Articles of Incorporation and a Statement of Information were filed for Studio 64 Recovery, the same as defendant Greatest Recovery, naming defendant Aguilar as the president, defendant Mouradian as the secretary and plaintiff has one of the directors.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that this outpatient business is functioning and producing funds for the business owned by the parties in this case.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that the relationship between plaintiff and defendant Mouradian declined, with the parties moving out of the apartment they shared and defendant Mouradian making threats to destroy plaintiff’s life.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that defendant Mouradian then took plaintiff’s social security card and credit cards and made unauthorized charges, causing his credit score to decrease, sent plaintiff insulting texts, attacked plaintiff’s companions, assaulted plaintiff, and hacked into plaintiff’s Google account.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that plaintiff sought a restraining order against defendant Mouradian, and two days later defendant Mouradian filed a petition for restraining order against plaintiff, as a result of which the parties stipulated to a mutual restraining order directing each of them to stay away from the other by 100 yards.&nbsp; This restraining order prevents plaintiff from visiting the business premises and from attending to business affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that on the date defendant Mouradian filed the petition for a restraining order against plaintiff, defendants filed Articles of Incorporation for Hollywood Hills Recovery and for Greatest Care Center, removing plaintiff’s name as director or officer of those entities.&nbsp; It is also alleged that the defendant Mouradian caused damage to plaintiff’s vehicle.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges he has served the board of directors with formal notice demanding plaintiff be permitted access to the books and records, demanding that defendants provide notice of any sale, conversion, merger or transfer of any assets of the corporations, and calling a special meeting relating to the ownership interests of the shareholders.&nbsp; Defendants have not permitted the accounting, have refused to call for or attend board of director meetings, and have failed to distribute profits.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that the individual defendants, and specifically defendant Mouradian, have been guilty of or knowingly countenanced pervasive fraud, mismanagement, abuse of authorities and unfairness toward plaintiff, whose property is being misapplied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendants Mouradian, Aboolian, Akopyan, Aguilar, Hillcrest Recovery Inc., and Studio 64 Recovery Inc. have filed a cross-complaint against plaintiff Khachadoorian, as cross-defendant, alleging that the individual parties entered into agreements with respect to the entity defendants Hillcrest Recovery and Studio 64 Recovery for the operation of substance use disorder and mental health treatment facilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cross-complaint alleges that based on the nature of the addiction treatment business, there was an implied agreement amongst the parties to maintain abstinence from drugs and alcohol, especially when they were physically present at the business premises.&nbsp; The cross-complaint alleges that all of the individual parties were in recovery from addiction or alcoholism themselves at the time the businesses commenced, and sobriety was mutually understood as a critical prerequisite for participating in the business.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The cross-complaint alleges that the beginning in September of 2021, cross-defendant Khachadoorian began acting erratically, so that business clients began reporting that cross-defendant appeared inebriated on site, and also that cross-defendant was developing inappropriate relationships with clients of the businesses.&nbsp; In March of 2022, cross-complainants requested, and cross-defendant agreed to submit a urine specimen for toxicology testing, which specimen tested positive for alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamines and benzodiazepines.&nbsp; It is alleged that when confronted with the drug test results, cross-defendant admitted to abusing drugs, and that he had stolen some of the drugs he was abusing from the businesses’ own medication disposal receptacles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In March of 2022, cross-defendant voted unanimously with the individual cross-complainants to amend the bylaws of the corporate cross-complainants to have cross-defendant resign from all positions within the corporations, and to reflect their written agreement that any corporate shareholder would forfeit and fully relinquish their ownership interest if they failed to remain abstinent from marijuana, alcohol, non-prescribed pharmaceutical, and illegal drugs.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cross-complaint alleges that cross-complainants paid for cross-defendant’s treatment and ongoing therapy, and supported cross-defendant in obtaining treatment, but cross-defendant left inpatient drug rehab early, and clients of the businesses observed cross-defendant’s old behaviors, causing cross-complainants to believe that cross-defendant continued to abuse drugs and alcohol through this period, and they ordered plaintiff to vacate the facility, determining his behavior was counter-productive to the recovery of the other residents.&nbsp; Cross-complainants allege that they tried to keep cross-defendant involved in the business by having him perform work off-site but discovered that cross-defendant had commenced a sexual relationship with a client of the businesses and had pressured the client to keep the event secret.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The cross-complaint alleges that cross-defendant’s actions jeopardized the licensure status and damaged the reputations of the businesses, causing drastic reductions in revenues and lasting financial repercussions, including the loss of clients.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Cross-complainants also allege that cross-defendant’s outside business dealings, pursuant to which cross-defendant became embroiled in a financial dispute related to a healthcare business run by cross-defendant’s mother, caused further compromise of the reputation and continued operation of the businesses.&nbsp; It is also alleged that cross-defendant continued to harass staff members and patients of the businesses when he encountered them at 12-step programs in the area, and during the course of hearings in the ongoing domestic dispute with cross-complainant Mouradian.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>In September of 2022, cross-complainants formally requested that cross-defendant forfeit his ownership interests in accordance with the terms of the March amendments, in response to which cross-defendant filed suit against cross-complainants.&nbsp; At a December 20, 2022 meeting of the board of directors of both entities, cross-complainants cancelled cross-defendant’s stock in each corporation, and authorized payment of $20,000 from each corporation pursuant to the March amendments.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="white-space: pre;

Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, reiterated that the Hill analysis is to be applied in determining the scope of discovery of private information, and that the burden to establish a privacy interest remains initially with the party asserting such an interest:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;“The state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy. (Cal. Const., art. I, § 1.) Protection of informational privacy is the provision's central concern. (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) In Hill, we established a framework for evaluating potential invasions of privacy. The party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious. (Id. at pp. 35–37, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.) The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A court must then balance these competing considerations. (Id. at pp. 37–40, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633.).”</div><div>Williams, at 552.&nbsp;</div><div>Here, defendant argues that Hillcrest plainly has a protected interest in its accounting files and has a reasonable expectation of privacy.&nbsp; It is not clearly argued that the threatened invasion of privacy here is serious.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also concedes that plaintiff claims the matters are relevant to determining a valuation of the business and to defend against defendant’s claims for damages, which is a legitimate countervailing interest favoring disclosure.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the party seeking protection, defendant argues that plaintiff does not have an interest in the entirety of the business’s financial records, but defendant does not propose a subset or a narrowing which would address the wrongdoing asserted by both plaintiff and cross-complainants concerning the operation of the business.&nbsp; Defendant seems to concede that this objection, as well as the trade secret objection, can be addressed by the entry of a protective order to limit the dissemination of the material to be produced to this litigation.&nbsp; This approach is an appropriate solution.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under the circumstances, the court is skeptical that defendant has met its initial burden to establish that the threatened intrusion into private information of the entity defendant is serious.&nbsp; Even if such a showing were to be assumed here, plaintiff has established a legitimate and important interest in pursuing relevant information in connection with the claims in this action and the cross-action concerning the operation of the business, and the damages being claimed by each side to their respective interests in the business.&nbsp; There does not appear to be any less intrusive means to discover the information.&nbsp; Hence, the court finds that the need for this information outweighs any privacy invasion argued by defendant, particularly once the parties enter into a stipulated protective order, or the court issues such an order, limiting disclosure of the information to those involved in this action.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are ordered to meet and confer with respect to entering a protective order, and to use the Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form provided by the Los Angeles Superior Court as a model, and which will serve as the court’s default.&nbsp; The parties should provide to the Court within five calendar days a redlined or compare copy of the proposed order as compared to the Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form, as required by the model, and the order will be reviewed by and entered by the court as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant has failed in opposition to justify any of the objections addressed, and once the protective order is in place, defendant must serve further responses without objection, and produce all responsive documents to this request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Requests Nos. 2-4</div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>These requests seek a copy of defendant’s general ledgers from December 8, 2020 to June 30, 2023, a copy of balance sheets and a copy of profit and loss statements for the same period.&nbsp;

&nbsp;The further response is without objections, and all responsive documents are ordered to be produced.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Request No. 15</div><div>This request seeks a copy of all corporate minutes for all meetings, regular or special, from December 2020 through the present.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The response is that general objections are incorporated by reference, and that discovery is ongoing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>These minutes are clearly relevant to the allegations in both the complaint and the cross-complaint concerning the operation of the business and the timeline concerning when certain actions were taken by plaintiff and defendants including Hillcrest officers and members, as well as in connection with plaintiff’s claimed entitlement to business record inspection.&nbsp; &nbsp;The materials accordingly are discoverable since that the defendant must justify any objection and refusal to produce.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant in opposition argues that the request is overbroad and lacks specificity related to the topics pertinent to the litigation.&nbsp; The request is only for such records for less than four years, and this overbreadth objection is not explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that defendant raises specific objection regarding the production of minutes that contain summaries of attorney-client privileged materials.&nbsp; Defendant then specifies five dates of minutes which “contain information protected by the attorney-client privilege.”&nbsp; [Aboolian Decl., para. 7].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear how any attorney-client privilege would not be waived to the extent material is included in corporate minutes which are open to inspection by those other than the clients in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, to the extent defendant intends to redact certain minutes or withhold information based on the attorney-client privilege, the court requires with the further responses and production the submission&nbsp; of a privilege log.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, the court refers to the provisions applicable to document demands in general, which the court finds is properly incorporated to address this dispute, CCP §2031.240 (c)(1) which provides:</div><div>“(c)(1) If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>The court finds that a privilege log is appropriate and necessary here.&nbsp;

Defendant has continued to take an improper position with respect to the content of any protective order, when a reasonable and standard protective order would have resolved this dispute as to several of the requests and eliminated any need on the part of defendant to continue to protect its trade secrets.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the expense of having had to make this motion to obtain an order concerning the production is appropriately shifted to defendant, since its conduct necessitated the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The sanctions sought are $8,851.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;As argued in the opposition, the sanctions are sought in the notice of motion against only defendant Hillcrest, so may not be awarded against defendant’s attorneys.&nbsp; CCP § 2023.040 requires, in pertinent part that, “A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party and attorney against whom the sanction is sought…”&nbsp; The notice does not identify any party, person, or attorney other than defendant Hillcrest.&nbsp; The sanctions are awarded only against defendant Hillcrest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that the sanctions sought include substantial fees and costs unrelated to the bringing of this motion and should be limited to the fees associated with bringing the motion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fees sought include time from before the deposition notice was served.&nbsp; As noted above, the motion is not considered or granted with respect to the August 2023 document demands, so the time pursuing that discovery will not be awarded.&nbsp; In addition, it appears from a review of all of the papers, as well as the excerpts of the deposition transcript submitted that the deposition was not entirely concluded, but it was expected that there would be another session, and that topics of substance were addressed at the deposition with the witness, so that the time spent at the deposition will not have been wasted, and the deposition costs would have been required to have been incurred twice regardless of the necessity for bringing or the outcome of this motion.&nbsp; The court finds that of the 16.1 hours at $300 sought for activity unrelated to the pursuing of the relief in this motion plaintiff’s counsel reasonably spent three (3) hours of time meeting and conferring and reviewing the protective order after the deposition notice was served, and during and after the deposition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The remaining fees, for 8 hours associated with this motion, are reasonable, and are awarded along with the three (3) hours awarded above, for a total of 11 hours at $300 per hour, $3,300 in fees.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The costs sought for filing fees, $61.65 plus $7.26 and $7.26 (reply) efiling fees will be awarded ($76.17).&nbsp; The costs sought for the court reporter and transcript of the deposition ($1,775.40) under the circumstances are not shifted to defendant and are not awarded.&nbsp; This result leaves a sanctions award of 11 hours at $300 per hour, plus costs of $$61.65 plus $7.26 and $7.26 for a total award of $3,376.17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions are sought by defendant based on defendant’s argument that plaintiff brought this motion before first properly meeting and conferring.&nbsp; As discussed above, the court does not find that the meet and confer was insufficient.&nbsp; Sanctions are not awarded on this ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Plaintiff Gewo Khachadoorian’s Motion to Compel Hillcrest Recovery, Inc.’s Production of Documents is GRANTED, pursuant to CCP § 2025.480.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Hillcrest Recovery, Inc. is ordered to serve further responses to the Documents to be Produced section included in Plaintiff Gewo Khachadoorian’s Notice of Taking Deposition of Defendant Hillcrest Recovery, Inc.’s Person Most Knowledgeable and Demand for Production of Documents and Things served on March 14, 2024, Requests Nos. 1-18, and to produce for inspection at deposition all materials described in the Notice of Taking Deposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The further response to Request No. 14 shall respond to the modified Request which is corrected by the Court to seek, “A copy of documents showing your accounts receivable as of June 30, 2023.”</div><div><br></div><div>The Court determines that the production sought is subject to discovery.&nbsp; Pursuant to CCP § 2025.480 (i), production is ordered to be made on the resumption of the deposition, which is ordered to occur on a mutually convenient date no later than June 21, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Amended responses are to be served within five days of the entry by the Court of a protective order, and such responses and the production are to be without objections, except for the amended response and production in response to Request No. 16, which may, if appropriate, assert objections based on attorney client privilege.&nbsp; Such objections shall be limited to corporate minutes dated December 30, 2022, November 25, 2022, October 28, 2022, September 20, 2022, August 30, 2022, and such objections must be accompanied by a privilege log.&nbsp; The Court finds a privilege log is necessary and must be included in any further response to Request No. 16 which includes objections on these grounds.&nbsp; The privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow a determination whether a withheld document is, in fact, privileged.&nbsp; See Wellpoint Health Networks, Inc v. Superior Court (1997, 2nd Dist.) 59 Cal.App.4th 110, 130.&nbsp; &nbsp;The privilege log must provide the identity and capacity of all individuals who authored, sent, or received each allegedly privileged document, the document's date, a brief description of the document and its contents or subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege applies, and the precise privilege or protection asserted.&nbsp; See Catalina Island Yacht Club v Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court has reviewed all other objections, and finds that defendant has failed to justify them, and they are without merit, so that all other objections are OVERRULED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically with respect to the objection concerning financial privacy, as discussed in detail above, defendant has not met the burden to establish a threatened intrusion into private information on the part of the entity defendant that is “serious.”&nbsp; Even if such a showing had been made, plaintiff has established a legitimate and important interest in pursuing relevant information in connection with the claims in this action in both the complaint and cross-complaint, and it appears that direct responses to the requests are the least intrusive means to discover the information.&nbsp; The Court finds the need for this information outweighs any privacy invasion argued by defendant, particularly once the parties enter into a stipulated protective order, limiting disclosure of the information to those involved in this action.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The parties are ordered to meet and confer with respect to entering a protective order, and to use the Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form provided by the Los Angeles Superior Court as a model.&nbsp; The parties are ordered to provide to the Court within five calendar days a redlined or compare copy of the proposed order as compared to the Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form, as required by the model, and the Court will review the order, considering the form the Court’s default, and a protective order will be entered by the Court as appropriate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court does not find acceptable a response to discovery which states that discovery is continuing or reserves the right to amend or supplement discovery responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Alternative request for order compelling responses pursuant to CCP section 2031.310 and/or 2031.300 as to requests from August 2023 is NOT CONSIDERED BY THE COURT in light of the granting of relief under CCP § 2025.480, as set forth above.</div><div><br></div><div>To the extent defendant argues that the Court should not grant relief pursuant to the Corporations Code, the Court does not do so, as such relief was not sought in the notice of motion and does not appear to the Court to be separately pursued in the moving papers in any event.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:&nbsp; Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $3,300.00 (11.0 hours @ $300/hour) [23.1 hours requested/11 recommended adjustment] plus costs of $61.65 plus $7.26 and $7.26 filing fees [Amount Requested $8,631.57/Amount Recommended Adjusted $3,376.17], which sum is to be awarded in favor of plaintiff Gewo Khachadoorian, and against defendant Hillcrest Recovery, Inc., payable within 30 days.&nbsp; CCP §§ 2025.480(j), 2023.010(d) and 2023.030(a) and CRC Rule 3.1348(a).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Monetary sanctions sought in the opposition are DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant Hillcrest Recovery, Inc.’s Request to Strike the Declaration of Estivi Ruiz in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is DENIED.&nbsp;

The complaint alleges that when plaintiff arrived at the Hospital, her vital signs showed she was hypersensitive and tachycardic.&nbsp; While in the emergency room, when asked her name, plaintiff identified several names, which were not her correct name, and plaintiff was also unable to provide a valid social security number.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that although attempts were made to take plaintiff’s blood and urine, the attempts were not successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that she was eventually seen by defendant Alec Bradleigh Freling, M.D., who diagnosed plaintiff with, among other conditions, psychosis due to methamphetamine use, schizoaffective disorder, and PCP use, and concluded that plaintiff appeared in a psychotic state.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that she was given a dose of haloperidol, medication used to treat psychotic patients, and an injection of lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medication.&nbsp; Plaintiff repeatedly requested that the psychiatrist evaluate her, and a request was entered by Dr. Freling for plaintiff to be seen by a psychiatrist.&nbsp; Dr. Freling later re-evaluated plaintiff and noted that she would not provide further information to him because he was a male and had requested to speak with a female behavioral health individual, so that Dr. Freling noted that a female, Tracy previously had attempted an evaluation during which plaintiff was uncooperative, and that Tracy would attempt to evaluate plaintiff again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges that plaintiff engaged in behavior such as telling the nursing staff she had been poisoned and requesting an ultrasound because she believed there were drugs inside her uterus, crying loudly, screaming, pulling the curtains on other patient’s beds and screaming and yelling.&nbsp; Plaintiff was asked to write down her social security number, but ultimately said she could not remember it.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that later that evening Dr. Freling noted that Tracy had evaluated plaintiff and that plaintiff had been cleared by the on-call psychiatrist, although there is no record plaintiff was seen or evaluated by a psychiatrist at any time during her presentation.&nbsp; It is alleged that Dr. Freling stated plaintiff was alert and oriented and had normal mood and affect, but there was no physical examination performed at that time to support such a conclusion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Freling then indicated that plaintiff would be discharged, and plaintiff requested of the nursing staff that she see someone else, but her request was denied, and she was told to call someone for a ride.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that after some further confusion, plaintiff ultimately called a friend to pick her up, and the nurses escorted plaintiff out of the hospital, essentially throwing her out of the facility, three hours after arriving, when plaintiff had never been seen or evaluated by a psychiatrist and had never had blood or urine work done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that after many instances of improper behavior in the car once plaintiff arrived at the friend’s house, plaintiff eventually walked to an overpass above the 15 freeway in Barstow and jumped off the overpass in an attempt to kill herself, as a result of which she suffered serious injuries.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The file shows that on April 21, 2023, plaintiff filed two Requests for Dismissal as to the moving party defendant Alec Bradleigh Freling, M.D.&nbsp; One Request was to dismiss the second cause of action only against that defendant, the second was to dismiss the third prayer for relief only.&nbsp; The third prayer for relief in the Complaint seeks, “For legal interest on judgment from the filing of this complaint to the date of judgment.”&nbsp; Both dismissals were entered as requested on April 21, 2023.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Procedural&nbsp;</div><div>There has been no timely opposition filed to this motion.&nbsp;

Mower, M.D., Ph.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The declaration adequately establishes Dr. Mower’s qualifications to testify as an expert, as Dr. Mower is a licensed physician with the appropriate education, training and professional experience, board certified in emergency medicine.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶¶ 1, 2].&nbsp; Dr. Mower indicates that he continuously has practiced emergency medicine since he became licensed as a physician.&nbsp; He has substantial professional experience working in emergency departments while assigned to provide emergency medical coverage in a general acute care hospital emergency department. [Mower Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A]. His CV shows that he has practiced as the Director of Informatics at the Emergency Department Sentinel Network—EMERGEncy ID.NET in Sylmar, California, from 1996 to the present. [Mower Decl. ¶¶ 1, 2, Ex. A].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Mower is familiar with the standard of care pertaining to patients presenting with a psychotic break or altered level of consciousness, answering questions inappropriately, which could be due to medical issues, mental issues, psychosis, or substance use.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶¶ 3].&nbsp; He is also familiar with the duties of emergency room providers in the assessment, treatment, and discharge of patients so presenting, as well as with the standard of care for patients declining medical care, blood draws and medications in the emergency room, and the rules, responsibilities and limitations involving a 5150 hold of a patient with respect to emergency medicine physicians.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 3].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The declaration also establishes that Dr. Mower has reviewed the complaint in this matter, and appropriate patient medical records, including the records from Glendale Adventist Medical Center, as well as plaintiff’s deposition transcript and the deposition transcript of Glendale Police Department Officer Meghedi Badall.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 4].&nbsp; &nbsp;Copies of the medical records relied on are attached to the Declaration of Lorraine Kim Hall, along with a declaration from the custodians of records.&nbsp; [Hall Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. F].&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Mower provides substantial testimony setting forth an understanding of the facts, and the reasons for Dr. Mower’s opinions.</div><div><br></div><div>Specifically, Dr. Mower states that it is Dr. Mower’s opinion that the care provided by plaintiff by Dr. Freling during plaintiff’s visit to the Hospital emergency department met the standard of care throughout the entirety of her presentation to the emergency department, complied at all times with the standard of care required of an emergency department physician under the circumstances, and that&nbsp; to a reasonable degree of medical probability there was no act or omission of Dr. Freling that caused or contributed to plaintiff’s injuries or outcomes.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶¶ 6-15].&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Mower explains that upon presentation Dr. Freling correctly assessed the patient and determined a psychiatric consultation was necessary, in compliance with the standard of care.&nbsp; Dr. Mower also states that, within the standard of care, given plaintiff’s presentation of altered level of consciousness and inability to answer questions appropriately, that Dr. Freling appropriately diagnosed the patient with acute psychosis, appropriately ordered laboratory studies, and appropriately ordered a psychiatric consult.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 8].&nbsp; Dr. Freling was also faced with a situation where plaintiff had requested to leave, and although plaintiff now alleges that she was in a mentally unstable condition and should not have been discharged home, Dr. Mower explains that to be held against her will would have required the issuance of a 5150 hold, which Dr. Freling, as an emergency medicine physician, did not have the authority to issue. [Mower Decl. ¶ 9].&nbsp; Dr. Mower indicates that Dr. Freling appropriately ordered a psychiatric consultation and ordered that the behavioral health team evaluate plaintiff a second time, after she became more cooperative.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 9].&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since neither the law enforcement officers who interviewed the patient in the emergency department nor the behavioral health team at the Hospital found grounds to issue a 5150 hold order, including the psychiatrist who consulted on this patient, and Dr. Freling was advised plaintiff did not meet the criteria and there were no grounds to keep her in the hospital against her will.&nbsp; Hence, Dr. Mower opines that it was within the standard of care for Dr. Freling to rely on the assessment that plaintiff was cleared from a psychiatric standpoint and was not a danger to herself or others at the time she was discharged from the emergency department. [Mower Decl. ¶ 10-12].&nbsp; Dr. Mower indicates that Dr. Freling again complied with the standard of care by ensuring the patient was medically stable for discharge, properly determining there was no medical issue separate and apart from a possible mental health issue requiring admission to the hospital.&nbsp; Consequently, Dr. Mower offers the opinion that Dr. Freling had no further obligations pursuant to the standard of care, particularly once he had ordered blood work and medications which the patient had refused, which was within her right to do.&nbsp; In a reevaluation, Dr. Freling confirmed that plaintiff had denied suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation and declined any further treatment at that time.&nbsp; This conduct was also within the standard of care.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶¶ 12, 13].&nbsp; Dr. Mower indicates that therefore Dr. Freling, properly discharged the patient home with a family member or friend, “Charles.”&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 13].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Mower also states his opinion based upon his review of the materials in this case, and based on his education, training, and experience, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that there was no act or omission by Dr. Freling that caused or contributed to plaintiff’s injuries or outcomes because there was no medical reason at that time to admit her to a hospital.&nbsp; Therefore, plaintiff’s accident from falling from/jumping off a freeway overpass was not caused by any medical condition with which she presented at the Hospital emergency department.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 14].&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Mower also points out that a 5150 hold can only be issued by law enforcement officers or members of a designated psychiatric/behavioral health team, which is why the standard of care for an emergency medical physician is to follow the recommendations of the behavioral health team.&nbsp; [Mower Decl. ¶ 7, 8].&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under Welfare &amp; Institutions Code § 5150 (a):</div><div>“(a) When a person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, a peace officer, professional person in charge of a facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment, member of the attending staff, as defined by regulation, of a facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment, designated members of a mobile crisis team, or professional person designated by the county may, upon probable cause, take, or cause to be taken, the person into custody for a period of up to 72 hours for assessment, evaluation, and crisis intervention, or placement for evaluation and treatment in a facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment and approved by the State Department of Health Care Services. <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>At a minimum, assessment, as defined in Section 5150.4, and evaluation, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 5008, shall be conducted and provided on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Crisis intervention, as defined in subdivision (e) of Section 5008, may be provided concurrently with assessment, evaluation, or any other service.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant argues that an emergency medicine provider does not have the statutory authority to place a patient under a 5150 under this section, which is correct.&nbsp; Accordingly, plaintiff would be unable to establish her claim under a theory that moving defendant engaged in medical negligence by improperly failing to place plaintiff under such a hold.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>It is held that “[w]hen a defendant moves for summary judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell within the community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.”&nbsp; Munro v.

Hernandez allege that in October of 2022, plaintiffs purchased a 2022 Kia EV6 with an accompanying written warranty issued by defendant Kia America Inc., pursuant to which Kia America, Inc. agreed to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the vehicle or provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiffs allege that the vehicle was delivered to plaintiffs with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities, including electrical and suspension system defects.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Plaintiffs allege that the defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves within the express warranty period, and substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.&nbsp; Plaintiffs delivered the vehicle to manufacturer’s authorized repair facility for repair of the nonconformities, and defendant has been unable to conform plaintiffs’ vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of repair attempts.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that notwithstanding plaintiffs’ entitlement, defendant has failed to either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or to promptly make restitution in accordance with the Song-Beverly Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The complaint alleges three causes of action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, for Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, and Civil Code section 1793.2.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. seeks by this motion to compel plaintiffs to attend and testify at deposition and produce documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>CCP § 2025.450 (a) provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”</div><div>Defendant indicates that defendant has served a Notice of Taking Deposition of Plaintiffs and Request for Production of Documents at Time of Deposition, plaintiffs have served objections to the notice on the ground the depositions were unilaterally set on a date and time that plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel were unavailable, and also objected to the requests for production of documents.&nbsp; [Rabiee Decl., paras. 2, 3, Exs.

&nbsp;Plaintiff alleges that upon discovering the deception, plaintiff demanded immediate repayment of the loaned funds from Hamadi, and that although Hamadi acknowledged the debt, he has refused to fulfill his obligation to pay plaintiff the money owed.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that defendant Keshishyan introduced plaintiff to her niece, who plaintiff married in 2016, and that defendant Hamadi thereafter cultivated a friendship with plaintiff under the guise of family ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges that in January of 2017, Hamadi and Keshishyan approached plaintiff seeking assistance in purchasing property in Carpinteria, assuring plaintiff the property had a potential to be profitable.&nbsp; Hamadi requested that he be added to plaintiff’s bank account, which would allow him to demonstrate sufficient funds in reserve, and plaintiff added Hamadi as a co-signer so that Hamadi could qualify for a loan.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Hamidi and Keshishyan sought an additional $65,000 from plaintiff to increase the down payment, with a promise to repay plaintiff within two months after refinancing the house.&nbsp; Plaintiff loaned Hamadi and Keshishyan the $65,000, and defendants qualified for the loan and the property was purchased in March of 2017.&nbsp; Despite defendants’ assurances and promises to repay the $65,000 within two months, defendants failed to repay the borrowed funds.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that beginning in June 2017 and continuing through October 2021, defendants made continued assurances and promises to plaintiff that they intended to repay the loan in its entirety, and that it was their intention to repay plaintiff in full.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC also alleges that in June of 2017, Hamadi informed plaintiff that he purchased life insurance policies totaling over five million dollars, with the intent to sell the policies after the two-year contestable period.&nbsp; Hamadi requested that plaintiff pay the insurance premiums for these policies for one year, with the agreement that Hamadi would pay the premiums for the second year, and thereafter the polices would be sold, and the profits split.&nbsp; Hamadi also promised to repay the $65,000 debt obligation to plaintiff from the sale of the insurance policies.&nbsp; In July and December of 2017, Hamadi purchased life insurance policies for his father and mother, and plaintiff began paying the premiums for the policies.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that to induce plaintiff to assume the obligation of the insurance premium payments, Hamadi arranged a meeting between plaintiff, himself, and the servicing insurance agent, defendant Minasyan, and that during this meeting Minasyan and Hamadi together assured plaintiff that it was a common practice to sell insurance policies after two years, that it was easy to find a willing buyer, and that plaintiff would financially benefit from the sale of the policies.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleges that at the time, defendants Hamadi and Minasyan knew that the policies would not be sold after a two-year period, that it was not easy to find a willing buyer with Hamadi being the beneficiary of the policies but conspired to induce plaintiff to pay the premiums to prevent the policies from lapsing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff also alleges that life insurance agents such as Minasyan receive as a commission the percentage of the premiums paid in the first year, so that by making representations and inducing plaintiff to pay for the premiums, Minasyan placed his interests over those of plaintiff in order to earn his commission.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At the conclusion of the first year, Hamadi refused to pay the premiums for the policies, leaving plaintiff no choice but to continue making the premium payments to avoid a lapse in coverage.&nbsp; Hamadi also threatened to not repay plaintiff’s loan and the payments plaintiff had made for the policies if plaintiff chose to discontinue paying the insurance premiums.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC alleges that while plaintiff continued to make the premium payments, Hamadi refused to sell the policies or repay plaintiff, and that in September of 2021, plaintiff contacted Minasyan and demanded that Hamadi assume the payment obligations.&nbsp; Hamadi requested an exit plan from Minasyan, and Minasyan agreed to assume Hamadi’s and plaintiff’s rights in the policies, and 30 days after the rights were assigned, repay plaintiff, including 10% interest.&nbsp; Hamadi refused to sign the agreement and refused to acknowledge his obligation for the insurance premium payments made by plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Plaintiff alleges that as a result of defendants’ conduct, plaintiff has suffered economic damages in an amount in excess of $274,697.24, plus interest, and that plaintiff has experienced severe emotional distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ANALYSIS:</div><div>Demurrer</div><div>First Cause of Action—Fraud, Second Cause of Action—Conspiracy to Defraud, Third Cause of Action—Intentional Misrepresentation and Fourth Cause of Action—Breach of Fiduciary Duty</div><div><br></div><div>Statute of Limitations&nbsp;</div><div>Defendant Sarkis Minasyan argues that all four causes of action asserted against this defendant are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.&nbsp; Defendant argues that the fraud and conspiracy to defraud causes of action are barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in CCP section 338 (d), and that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is subject to a two-year statute of limitations.&nbsp; Defendant relies on Hydro-Mill Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton &amp; Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc.&nbsp; (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1145, in which the Second District, in connection with a claim against an insurance broker for breach of fiduciary, applied a two-year statute of limitations, finding the breach of fiduciary duty claim, regardless of its label, amounted “to a claim of professional negligence.”&nbsp; Hydro-Mill, at 1159.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In general, the statute of limitations is mandatory, based on the language of CCP section 312, which provides:</div><div>“Civil actions, without exception, can only be commenced within the periods prescribed by this title...unless, where, in special cases, a different limitation is prescribed by statute.”</div><div><br></div><div>A demurrer on the ground a cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations should be sustained only where the facts alleged on the face of the complaint “clearly and affirmatively” show that the cause of action is barred.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not enough that the complaint might be barred.&nbsp; &nbsp;Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As to the fraud causes of action, CCP § 338(d) provides that “an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake” must be commenced within three years.&nbsp; CCP § 338(d) provides that in an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, “The cause of action in that case is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant argues that the causes of action against defendant are based on purported representations that it was common practice to sell insurance policies after two years, that it was easy to find a willing buyer, and that plaintiff would benefit financially from the sale of the policies.&nbsp; [FAC, paras. 23, 44, 49, 65, 75].&nbsp; Defendant argues that these purported misrepresentations were made in a meeting, and that although the exact date of the meeting is not alleged, the meeting must have occurred before plaintiff agreed to undertake payment of the insurance premiums.&nbsp; [FAC, para. 23].&nbsp; The FAC alleges that plaintiff started making premium payments, “beginning in 2017.”&nbsp; [FAC, para. 22].&nbsp; Defendant argues it is reasonable to infer that the representations occurred sometime in 2017, accrued at that time, so that the complaint would be required to be filed by 2019 or 2020.&nbsp; This action was filed on September 15, 2023, which defendant argues is years late.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Defendant also argues that alternatively, assuming that plaintiff will argue plaintiff did not discover that the statements were false until later, the purported falseness of the statements should have become apparent to plaintiff no later than 2019, two years after the representations were made, because Hamadi had allegedly promised plaintiff that the policies would be sold within two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is not clear from the face of the pleading that the alleged misrepresentations by this defendant were or should have been discovered at some earlier time, as the fact that the policies were not in fact sold within two years does not suggest that the representations concerning the ease of doing so from a life insurance broker were false and could not continue to be relied upon.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The FAC affirmatively alleges that defendants made continuous reassurances that plaintiff would be repaid, and specifically that Minasyan continued to be involved with the transaction, and ultimately proposed an exit plan, agreeing to assume the parties’ rights and interests in the life insurance policy, which agreement was alleged to have occurred in October of 2021. [FAC, paras. 18, 29, 31-33]&nbsp; &nbsp; Plaintiff in opposition argues that, as alleged in the FAC, it was not until October of 2021 when neither Hamadi nor Minasyan signed the agreement, which Minasyan had proposed, that plaintiff discovered the fraud perpetuated by defendants.&nbsp; &nbsp;[FAC, para. 33].&nbsp; It is clear that it would reasonably be at some time after that date when plaintiff would be expected to have undertaken some investigation into the correctness of the representations made by Minasyan to induce plaintiff to enter into the transaction in the first place, and to cause plaintiff to continue to pay the premiums based on the information about the ease of sale.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it is not clear from the allegations that the causes of action clearly and affirmatively are time barred.&nbsp; Hence, the demurrer to these causes of action is overruled on this ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First Cause of Action—Fraud and Third Cause of Action—Intentional Misrepresentation&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>To state a cause of action for fraud, plaintiff must plead the following elements: A false representation, actual or implied, or concealment of a matter of fact material to the transaction which defendant had a duty to disclose, or defendant’s promise made without intention to perform; defendant’s knowledge of the falsity; defendant’s intent to deceive; plaintiff’s justifiable reliance thereon; and resulting damage to plaintiff.&nbsp; Pearson v.

Bramblett (1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 36, 47; Greenwood v. Mooradian (1955) 137 Cal.App.2d 532, 535.&nbsp; These allegations are made here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The demurrer also argues that defendant Hamadi has refused to sell the policies, negating any assertion that defendant’s misrepresentations regarding the salability of the policies was false.&nbsp; There may be concurrent causation here.&nbsp; However, the FAC in any case alleges that the representations by the moving defendant were in fact false, which allegations must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer.

Defendant argues that there are no facts supporting plaintiffs’ conclusory statements that the case involves a number of existing/potential issues and causes of action, that obtaining the information requires investigation/consultation not available at deposition, or that the additional discovery is not propounded for the purpose of harassing defendant, as required under statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The declarations primarily consist of a statement of the factors, without supporting details.&nbsp;

The declarations are deficient.&nbsp; The declarations explain that this factor is furthered because of “the appropriateness of this discovery device (interrogatories) - to have Defendant set forth facts that may require investigation and consultation with other persons-over a deposition wherein the deponent would not have the opportunity to conduct an investigation and consult with other persons.” [Decls., para. 5(3)].&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The interrogatories in fact consist in part of contention interrogatories.&nbsp; This argument supports this type of discovery in initial written discovery.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The plaintiffs’ position is that interrogatories are particularly effective in gathering information concerning contentions, because when a party prepares responses to interrogatories, that party is under an obligation to provide information from all sources, not just information within the party’s personal knowledge.&nbsp; Defendant claims that a deponent’s testimony necessarily is limited to only facts or information based on the personal knowledge of the deponent, which is all that is required at deposition.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 2030.220(a), in connection with interrogatories, “each answer in a response shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.”&nbsp;

Plaintiffs have sufficiently explained the need for the additional discovery.&nbsp; The motion for a protective order is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion also argues that many of the special interrogatories duplicate form interrogatories, and lists those interrogatories by number.&nbsp; There is no sufficient argument comparing the language of each discovery request so that the court could make an informed determination concerning whether the discovery is strictly duplicative.&nbsp; Hence, the court cannot make a finding that the discovery is improper on this ground.&nbsp; The court is not required to conduct this examination on its own.</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, the argument, practically speaking, appears to somewhat undermine defendant’s argument that responding to these additional discovery requests would be burdensome and harassing.&nbsp; If the argument is valid, and there is strict duplication, defendant can object on this ground.&nbsp; In any case, defendant has already indicated that responses have been served to the form interrogatories.&nbsp; In this day of word processing, the defendants’ burden to cut and paste the same response would be minimal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The motion for a protective order is denied.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP § 2030.090 (c):</div><div>“(c) If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court may order that the party provide or permit the discovery against which protection was sought on terms and conditions that are just.”</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Defendant will be ordered to permit the discovery and serve verified responses to the special interrogatories.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Both sides seek monetary sanctions.&nbsp; CCP § 2030.090(d) provides:</div><div>&nbsp;“The court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any party, person or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective order under this section, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here, the motion for a protective order is denied.&nbsp; Hence, the motion has not been unsuccessfully opposed, so no sanctions are awarded to the moving party.&nbsp; The motion has been unsuccessfully made, but the court will find that there was sufficient technical defect in the declarations for additional discovery so that defendant was substantially justified in pursuing defendant’s position on this ground.&nbsp; No sanctions are awarded.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>RULING:</div><div>Motion by Defendant Narine Gharibyan for a Protective Order Regarding Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories is DENIED.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pursuant to CCP § 2030.090 (c), the Court orders that defendant Narine Gharibyan serve and given that the court has denied defendants’ Motion for a Protective Order, responses to Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set Number One propounded by plaintiff Jozef Gharabigi and Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set Number One propounded by plaintiff Meganoush Azarjeh within thirty days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Requests for monetary sanctions by both sides are DENIED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE&nbsp;</div><div>AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCES</div><div><br></div><div>Please make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.&nbsp; Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.&nbsp; However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.&nbsp;</div><span name="wp"><hr><p class="fontChange"><b> Case Number: </b> 24NNCP00059&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Hearing Date: </b>  May 17, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Dept: </b> D</p><p class="fontChange"> </p><div>TENTATIVE RULING</div><div><br></div><div>Calendar:&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>12<span style="white-space:pre">					</span></div><div>Date:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5/17/2024</div><div>Case No:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>24 NNCP00059</div><div>Case Name:<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Apollo Mathers, LLC v.

We disagree. We conclude that California Uniform Commercial Code section 9408 evidences a public policy against antiassignment provisions in general and that the SSTA, Insurance Code section 10136 et seq., evidences a public policy in favor of court-approved factoring transactions.&nbsp; Thus, public policy favors the legal conclusion that antiassignment provisions do not bar court-approved transfers of structured settlement payments.</div><div><br></div><div>Therefore, we conclude that, where no interested parties object to the transfer of structured settlement payment rights, the antiassignment provisions in the annuity contract, settlement agreement or other related contracts do not bar the factoring transaction at issue in this appeal.”</div><div>321 Henderson Receivables Origination LLC v.

The new hearing date is May 17, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Judgment debtor defendant Sarkesyan must file his supplemental briefing by April 26, 2024 with judgment creditor plaintiff Citibank’s responsive pleading due on May 16, 2024.</div><div>[Minute Order 04/12/2024, p. 5].</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space: normal;"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There has been no timely supplemental briefing filed by April 26, 2024 by judgment debtor defendant Sarkesyan.&nbsp; The claim of exemption now accordingly is denied based on the defects previously identified by the court, as follows.&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The claim of exemption is evidently directed to a levy of the judgment debtor’s bank account with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America is holding funds.&nbsp; It is not clear what sum is being held.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 703.580(c), at a hearing on a claim for exemption</div><div>“The claim of exemption is deemed controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both shall be received in evidence.&nbsp; If no other evidence is offered, the court, if satisfied that sufficient facts are shown by the claim of exemption (including the financial statement if one is required) and the notice of opposition, may make its determination thereon.&nbsp; If not satisfied, the court shall order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or documentary.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It appears that the method of judgment enforcement involved here is the levy of a bank account.&nbsp; Under CCP section 703.520, a claimant after levy may make a claim of exemption, which is required to be executed under oath and provide specified information, including a financial statement if required, a citation to the provision or statute upon which the claim is based, and a statement of facts necessary to support the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Under CCP section 703.580(b), at a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the exemption claimant has the burden of proof.”&nbsp; In meeting this burden, the one who claims the exemption must establish the right by evidence or facts; an affidavit which merely follows the language of the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient.&nbsp; &nbsp;See Le Font v.

[Claim, para. 8c].&nbsp; Judgment debtor indicates that the property is claimed to be exempt under CCP section 703.140(b)(5).&nbsp; [Claim, para. 5].&nbsp; The claim includes an attachment which states that California law allows judgment debtor to exempt and protect up to approximately $30,000 of funds under Civil Code 703.140(b)(5).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>CCP section 703.140 applies to federal Bankruptcy proceedings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Subdivision (a) of the statute indicates that the listed exemptions are “applicable,” “In a case under Title 11 of the United States Code.”&nbsp; &nbsp;This does not appear to be such a case.&nbsp;

The claim is denied on this ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition also points out that with respect to the bank account at issue, judgment debtor has the burden of tracing exempt funds from an exempt source under CCP section 703.080, which provides, in pertinent part:</div><div>“(a) Subject to any limitation provided in the particular exemption, a fund that is exempt remains exempt to the extent that it can be traced into deposit accounts or in the form of cash or its equivalent.</div><div>(b) The exemption claimant has the burden of tracing an exempt fund.”</div><div><br></div><div>The opposition argues that here judgment debtor in support of the claim has failed to trace the source of funds or provide any documentation proving the funds levied consist only of exempt funds.</div><div><br></div><div>Without any documentation to support the purported claim of exemption, the claim cannot be evaluated.&nbsp;
